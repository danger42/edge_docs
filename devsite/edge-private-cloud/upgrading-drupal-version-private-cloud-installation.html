  {% extends "private-cloud/v4.18.01/_base.html" %} {% block title %}Upgrading the Drupal version
  of a Private Cloud installation{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This upgrade is for your Private Cloud installation of Drupal
  only. For customers using a cloud deployment of the portal, Apigee will automatically apply all
  Drupal security updates.</aside>

  <p>In an Edge for Private Cloud installation of the Developer Services portal, you might get a
  notification that a new version of Drupal is available. A new version can mean a Drupal feature
  release, patch, security update, or other type of Drupal update. In the case of a security
  update, you want to upgrade your installation of Drupal as soon as possible to ensure that your
  site remains secure.</p>

  <p>The procedure below describes how to update a Private Cloud installation of Drupal 7.x.y to
  another minor version (for example Drupal 7.54 to 7.56).</p>

  <p>Please note the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>This procedure only updates your installation of Drupal. It does not update the Apigee
      software that ships as part of the portal. For information on upgrading the Apigee portal
      software, see
      <a href="/private-cloud/v4.18.01/upgrading-developer-services-portal">Upgrading the Developer Services portal</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>You have to run Drush commands from the root directory of the portal site. By default, the
    Developer Portal is installed at:
      <ul>
        <li><code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code> (Nginx)</li>
        <li><code>/var/www/html</code> (Apache)</li>
      </ul>The procedure below assumes an Nginx server installation at the default location above.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="determiningyourcurrentdrupalversion">Determining your current Drupal version</h2>

  <p>Before you start the Drupal update, you can determine your current Drupal version by running
  the following command from the Drupal installation folder. By default, Drupal is installed in
  <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code>:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">cd /opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</pre>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush status | grep 'Drupal version'</pre>

  <p>You should see output in the form:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
Drupal version          :  7.54
</pre>

  <p>If you installed Drupal in a directory other than <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code>,
  make sure to change to that directory before running the <code>drush</code> command.</p>

  <h2 id="updatingthedrupalversion">Updating the Drupal version</h2>

  <p>This section describes how to use <a href="https://www.drush.org" class="external">Drush</a>
  (Drupal Shell) from a command line to update your Drupal version. See also,
  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2550801" class="external">Updating Drupal Using Drush</a> in the Drupal documentation.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If your portal is on a server with no external internet
  connection, then download the drupal installation to a server with internet access, copy the
  drupal-x.y directory to your portal server, and follow the steps described in the
  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/upgrade-to-drupal-7/read-upgradetxt" class="external">README.txt</a>
  file in the Drupal documentation.</aside>

  <p>To update your Drupal installation:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Change to the <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code>
      directory, or the directory where you installed the portal.</li>
    <li>Make a full backup of all files, directories, and databases. Save the backup in a location
      outside of the Drupal installation. For complete instructions, see
      <a href="/private-cloud/latest/backup-portal">Back up the portal</a>.
      <p>If you made modifications to files such as <code>.htaccess</code>,
      <code>robots.txt</code>, or <code>defaults.settings.php</code> (in the <code>sites</code>
      directory), you will have to reapply the changes after the update. You will also need to
      reapply any customizations made in the <code>sites/all</code> directory.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Put your site into maintenance mode: <br>
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush vset --exact maintenance_mode 1</pre>
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush cache-clear all</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Install the desired version of Drupal by using the following command:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush pm-update drupal-7.56</pre>
      <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Replace 7.56 with the desired version.</aside>
      <p>Alternatively, you can run <code>drush pm-update drupal</code> to update to the latest Drupal
      core version. You can run <code>drush pm-updatestatus</code> to list available
      minor updates to Drupal core and contrib projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Reapply any changes made to <code>.htaccess</code>, <code>robots.txt</code>,
      or <code>defaults.settings.php</code> (in
      the <code>sites</code> directory).</li>
    <li>Reapply any changes made to the <code>sites/all </code>directory.</li>

    <li>Take your site out of maintenance mode: <br>
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush vset --exact maintenance_mode 0</pre>
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush cache-clear all</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="whatifiencounteranissueduringtheupdate">What if I encounter an issue during the
  update?</h2>

  <p>Restore your site to its previous state using the backup files that you created. Contact your
  Apigee support representative and provide any error messages that were reported during the
  update.</p>
