  <p>{{portal_1st_use}} acts as a client of Apigee Edge. That means the portal does not
  function as a stand-alone system. Instead, much of the information used by the portal is actually
  stored on Edge. When necessary, the portal makes a request to retrieve information from Edge or
  to send information to Edge.</p>

  <p>The portal is always associated with a single Edge organization. When you configure the
  portal, you can specify the basic authentication credentials (username and password) for an
  account in the organization that the portal uses to communicate with Edge.</p>

  <p>If you choose to enable SAML for Edge authentication, you can then configure the portal to use
  SAML authentication when making requests to Edge. Configuring the portal to use SAML
  automatically creates a new machine user account in the Edge organization that the portal then
  uses to make requests to Edge. For more on machine users, see <a href=
  "using-saml-automated-tasks">Using SAML with automated tasks</a>.</p>

  <p>SAML support for the portal requires that you have already installed and configures the Edge
  SSO module on the Edge Management Server node. The general process for enabling SAML for the
  portal is:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Configure SAML on Edge as described in <a href=
    "installation-and-configuration-saml-edge">Installation and configuration of SAML for
    Edge</a>. <strong>Note</strong>: Basic Auth must still be enabled on Edge to install the
    portal. Do not disable Basic Auth on Edge until after you have configured the portal to use
    SAML.</li>

    <li>Install the portal and ensure that your installation is working properly. See <a href=
    "installing-edge-private-cloud-developer-services-portal">Installing the Edge for Private
    Cloud portal</a>.</li>

    <li>Configure SAML on the portal.</li>

    <li>You can now disable Basic Auth on Edge.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="creatingamachineuserfortheportal">Creating a machine user for the portal</h2>

  <p>When SAML is enabled, Edge supports automated OAuth2 token generation through the use of
  <em>machine users</em>. A machine user can obtain OAuth2 tokens without having to specify a
  passcode. That means you can completely automate the process of obtaining and refreshing OAuth2
  tokens.</p>

  <p>The SAML configuration process for the portal automatically creates a machine user in the
  organization associated with the portal. The portal then uses this machine user account to
  connect to Edge. For more on machine users, see <a href="using-saml-automated-tasks">Using
  SAML with automated tasks</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="aboutauthenticationforportaldeveloperaccounts">About authentication for portal developer
  accounts</h2>

  <p>When you configure the portal to use SAML, you enable the portal to use SAML to authenticate
  with Edge so that the portal can make requests to Edge. However, the portal also supports a type
  of user called <em>developers</em>.</p>

  <p>Developers make up the community of users that build apps by using your APIs. App developers
  use the portal to learn about your APIs, to register apps that use your APIs, to interact with
  the developer community, and to view statistical information about their app usage on a
  dashboard.</p>

  <p>When a developer logs in to the portal, it is the portal that is responsible for
  authenticating the developer and for enforcing role-based permissions. The portal continues to
  use basic authentication with developers even after you enable SAML between the portal and Edge.
  For more, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/communicating-between-developer-services-portal-and-edge.html">Communicating
  between the portal and Edge</a>.</p>

  <p>It is possible to also configure the portal to use SAML to authenticate developers. For an
  example on enableng SAML using third-party Drupal modules, see
  <a href="{{community_article}}/29201/sso-integration-via-saml-with-developer-portal.html" class="external">SSO Integration via SAML with Developer Portal</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="configuresamlontheportaltocommunicatewithedge">Configure SAML on the portal to
  communicate with Edge</h2>

  <p>To configure SAML for the portal, you must create a config file to configure the portal:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
# IP address of Edge Management Server and apigee-sso node.
IP1=22.222.22.222

# URL of Edge management API.
MGMT_URL=http://$IP1:8080/v1

# Org associated with the portal.
EDGE_ORG=myorg

# Information about apigee-sso.
# Externally accessible IP or DNS of apigee-sso.
SSO_PUBLIC_URL_HOSTNAME=$IP1
SSO_PUBLIC_URL_PORT=9099
# Default is http. Set to https if you enabled TLS on apigee-sso.
SSO_PUBLIC_URL_SCHEME=http

# SSO admin credentials as set when you installed apigee-sso.
SSO_ADMIN_NAME=ssoadmin
SSO_ADMIN_SECRET=Secret123

# Default is "n" to disable SAML support.
DEVPORTAL_SSO_ENABLED=y

# The name of the OAuth client used to connect to apigee-sso. 
# The default client name is portalcli.
PORTALCLI_SSO_CLIENT_NAME=portalcli
# Oauth client password using uppercase, lowercase, number, and special chars. 
PORTALCLI_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=Abcdefg@1

# Email address and user info for the machine user created in 
# the Edge org specified above by EDGE_ORG. 
# This account is used by the portal to make requests to Edge.
# Add this email as an org admin before configuring the portal to use SAML. 
DEVPORTAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=DevPortal_SAML@google.com
DEVPORTAL_ADMIN_FIRSTNAME=DevPortal
DEVPORTAL_ADMIN_LASTNAME=SAMLAdmin
DEVPORTAL_ADMIN_PWD=Abcdefg@1

# If set, the existing portal OAuth client is deleted and new one is created.
# The default value is "n".
# Set to "y" when you configure SAML and change the value of 
# any of the PORTALCLI_* properties.
PORTALCLI_SSO_CLIENT_OVERWRITE=y
</pre>

  <p>To enable SAML support on the portal:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Edge UI, add the machine user specified by <code>DEVPORTAL_ADMIN_EMAIL</code> to the
      organization associated with the portal as an <strong>Organization Administrator</strong>.
      <aside class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The machine user does not exist yet but is created
      automatically in the next step.</aside>
    </li>
    <li>Run the following command to configure SAML on the portal:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service apigee-drupal-devportal configure-sso -f <var>samlConfigFile</var></pre>
      <p>Where <var>samlConfigFile</var> is the SAML config file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Log in to the portal as a portal admin.</li>
    <li>In the main Drupal menu, select <strong>Configuration &gt; Dev Portal</strong>. The portal
      configuration screen appears, including the SAML settings:
      <p><img alt="" src="/private-cloud/images/portalWithSAML.png"></p>
      <p>Note that the box for <strong>This org is SAML-enabled</strong> is
      checked, the endpoint for the Edge SSO module is filled in, the <strong>API key</strong> and
      <strong>Consumer secret</strong> fields for the portal Oauth client are filled in, and the
      message <strong>Connection Successful</strong> appears under the <strong>Test
      Connection</strong> button.</p>
    </li>
    <li>You can press the <strong>Test Connection</strong> button to retest the connection at
      any time.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To later change these values, update the config file and run the command again.</p>

  <h2 id="disablesamlontheportal">Disable SAML on the portal</h2>

  <p>If you choose to disable SAML for communications between the portal and Edge, the portal will
  no longer be able to make requests to Edge. Developers are able to log in to the portal but will
  not be able to view product or create apps.</p>

  <aside class="caution"><strong>Caution</strong>: If you disable SAML, you should then reconfigure
  it the portal to either use SAML or, if Edge is still configured to supports Basic Auth, configure
  the portal to communicate with Edge using Basic Auth. For more on using Basic Auth see
  <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/communicating-between-developer-services-portal-and-edge">Communicating
  between the portal and Edge</a>.</aside>

  <p>To disable SAML on the portal:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Edit the config file that you used to configure SAM to set:
      <pre>DEVPORTAL_SSO_ENABLED=n</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Configure the portal:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service apigee-drupal-devportal configure-sso -f <var>configFile</var></pre>
    </li>
