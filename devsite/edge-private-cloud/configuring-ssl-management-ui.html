{% block title %}Configuring TLS for the management UI{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

  <p>By default, you access the Edge management UI over HTTP by using the IP address of the
  Management Server node and port 9000. For example:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">http://<var>ms_IP</var>:9000</pre>

  <p>Alternatively, you can configure TLS access to the management UI so that you can access it in
  the form:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">https://<var>ms_IP</var>:9443</pre>

  <p>In this example, you configure TLS access to use port 9443. However, that port number is not
  required by Edge - you can configure the Management Server to use other port values. The only
  requirement is that your firewall allows traffic over the specified port. </p>

  <h2 id="ensurethatyourtlsportisopen">Ensure that your TLS port is open</h2>

  <p>The procedure in this section configures TLS to use port 9443 on the Management Server.
  Regardless of the port that you use, you must ensure that the port is open on the Management
  Server. For example, you can use the following command to open it:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9443 -j ACCEPT --verbose</pre>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> This example uses port 9443 for the TLS port, and not the more common port 443.
    The reason is that ports below 1024 are typically protected by the operating system and require
    the process that accesses them to have root access. The Edge UI runs as the "apigee" user and
    therefore typically does not have access to ports below 1024.

    <p>One alternative it to use a load balancer with the Edge UI and terminate TLS on the load
    balancer on port 443. You can then use either HTTP or HTTPS between the load balancer and the
    Edge UI. </p>

    <p>Another alternative is to use <code>iptables</code> to forward requests to port 443 to
    port 9443. For example:</p>
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 9443</pre>
  </aside>

  <h2 id="configuretls">Configure TLS</h2>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you have multiple UI instances installed on separate nodes,
  you must configure both to support TLS. After enabling TLS on the first node, see <a href=
  "supporting-multiple-edge-ui-instances">Supporting multiple Edge UI instances</a> for
  information about configuring TLS on the second node. </aside>

  <p>Use the following procedure to configure TLS access to the management UI:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Generate the keystore JKS file containing your TLS certification and private key and copy
    it to the Management Server node. For more information, see <a href=
    "configuring-ssl-edge-premises">Configuring TLS/SSL for Edge On Premises</a>.</li>
    <li>Run the following command to configure TLS:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-ui configure-ssl</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Enter the HTTPS port number, for example, 9443.</li>
    <li>Specify if you want to disable HTTP access to the management UI. By default, the management
      UI is accessible over HTTP on port 9000.</li>
    <li>Enter the keystore algorithm. The default is JKS.</li>
    <li>Enter the absolute path to the keystore JKS file.
      <p>The script copies the file to the <code>/opt/apigee/customer/conf</code> directory on the
      Management Server node, and changes the ownership of the file to "apigee".</p>
    </li>
    <li>Enter the clear text keystore password.</li>
    <li>The script then restarts the Edge management UI. After the restart, the management UI
      supports access over TLS.
      <p>You can see these settings in <code>/opt/apigee/etc/edge-ui.d/SSL.sh</code>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can also pass a config file to the command instead of responding to prompts. The config
  file takes the following properties:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">HTTPSPORT=9443
DISABLE_HTTP=y
KEY_ALGO=JKS
KEY_FILE_PATH=/opt/apigee/customer/application/mykeystore.jks
KEY_PASS=<var>clearTextKeystorePWord</var></pre>

    <p>Then use the following command to configure TLS of the Edge UI:</p>
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-ui configure-ssl -f <var>configFile</var></pre>

  <h2 id="configuretheedgeuiwhentlsterminatesontheloadbalancer">Configure the Edge UI when TLS
  terminates on the load balancer</h2>

  <p>If you have a load balancer that forwards requests to the Edge UI, you might choose to
  terminate the TLS connection on the load balancer, and then have the load balancer forward
  requests to the Edge UI over HTTP. This configuration is supported but you need to configure the
  load balancer and the Edge UI accordingly.</p>

  <p>The additional configuration is required when the Edge UI sends users emails to set their
  password when the user is created or when the user request to reset a lost password. This email
  contains a URL that the user selects to set or reset a password. By default, if the Edge UI is
  not configured to use TLS, the URL in the generated email uses the HTTP protocol, and not HTTPS.
  You must configure the load balancer and Edge UI to generates an email address that uses
  HTTPS.</p>

  <p>To configure the load balancer, ensure that it sets the following header on requests forwarded
  to the Edge UI:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">X-Forwarded-Proto: https</pre>

  <p>To configure the Edge UI:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open the <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/ui.properties</code>
      file in an editor. If the file does not exist, create it:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">vi /opt/apigee/customer/application/ui.properties</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Set the following property in <code>ui.properties</code>:
      <pre>conf/application.conf+trustxforwarded=true</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Save your changes to <code>ui.properties</code>.</li>
    <li>Restart the Edge UI:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-ui restart</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="disabletlsontheedgeui">Disable TLS on the Edge UI</h2>

  <p>To disable TLS on the Edge UI, use the following command:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-ui disable-ssl</pre>
