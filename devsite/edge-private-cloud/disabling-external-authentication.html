  <p>Perform these steps if you want to turn off external authentication and revert to using the
  internal authentication LDAP in Apigee Edge.</p>

  <aside class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Important: You must do the following steps on
  each Apigee Edge Management Server.</aside>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/management-server.properties</code>
      in a text editor.</li>
    <li>Set the <code>conf_security_authentication.user.store</code> property to
      <code>ldap</code>.
      <aside class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure that there are no trailing spaces at the
      end of the line.</aside>
      <pre>conf_security_authentication.user.store=ldap</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>OPTIONALLY, only applicable if you were using a non-email address username or a
      different password in your external LDAP for your sysadmin user.</strong> Follow the steps
      you previously followed in <a href=
      "additional-configuration-required-event-different-sysadmin-credentials">Configuration
      required for different sysadmin credentials</a>, but substitute the external LDAP username
      with your Apigee Edge sysadmin user's email address.</li>
    <li>Restart the Management Server:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-management-server restart</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Verify that the server is running:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all status</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Important</strong>: An Edge organization administrator must
        take the following actions after external authentication is turned off:
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure there are no users in Apigee Edge that should not be there. You need to
            manually remove those users.</li>
          <li>Communicate to users that because the external authentication has been turned off, they
            need to either start using whatever their original password was (if they remember) or
            complete a "forgot password" process in order to log in.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
