  <p>Perform these steps if you want to turn off external authentication and revert to using the
  internal authentication LDAP in Apigee Edge. </p>

  <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> Important: You must do the following steps on each Apigee
  Edge Management Server.</aside>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/opt/apigee/customer/application/management-server.properties</span>
    in a text editor. </li>

    <li>Set the <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">conf_security_authentication.user.store</span>
    property to <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">ldap</span>. <strong>Note</strong>: Be sure
    that there are no trailing spaces at the end of the line.<br>
    <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">conf_security_authentication.user.store=ldap</span></li>

    <li><strong>OPTIONALLY, only applicable if you were using a non-email address username or a
    different password in your external LDAP for your sysadmin user. </strong>Follow the steps
    you previously followed in <a href=
    "additional-configuration-required-event-different-sysadmin-credentials.html">Configuration
    required for different sysadmin credentials</a>, but substituting the external LDAP username
    with your Apigee Edge sysadmin user&#8217;s email address.</li>

    <li>Restart the Management Server:<br>
    <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&gt; /opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service
    edge-management-server restart</span></li>

    <li>Verify that the server is running:<br>
    <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&gt; /opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all
    status</span></li>

    <li>
      <strong>Important</strong>: An Edge organization administrator must take the following
      actions after external authentication is turned off:

      <ul>
        <li>Make sure there are no users in Apigee Edge that should not be there. You need to
        manually remove those users. </li>

        <li>Communicate to users that because the external authentication has been turned off, they
        need to either start using whatever their original password was (if they remember) or
        complete a "forgot password" process in order to log in.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
