  <p>This document explains how authentication and authorization work on Apigee Edge. This
  information may provide useful context when you configure an external LDAP with Apigee Edge.</p>

  <p>The authentication and authorization flows depend whether a user authenticates through the
  management UI or through the APIs.</p>

  <h2 id="whenlogginginthroughtheui">When logging in through the UI</h2>

  <p>When you log in to Edge through the UI, Edge performs a separate login step to the Apigee
  Management Server using the Edge global system administrator credentials.</p>

  <p>The following UI login steps are illustrated in Figure 1:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The user enters login credentials in the login UI.</li>
    <li>Edge logs in to the Management Server using the global system admin credentials.</li>
    <li>The global system admin credentials are authenticated and authorized. The UI uses these
      credentials to make certain platform API requests.
      <ol>
        <li>If external authentication is enabled, the credentials are authenticated against the
          external LDAP, otherwise, the internal Edge LDAP is used.</li>
        <li>Authorization is always performed against the internal LDAP.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The credentials entered by the user are authenticated and authorized.
      <ol>
        <li>If external authentication is enabled, the credentials are authenticated against the
          external LDAP, otherwise, the internal Edge LDAP is used.</li>
        <li>Authorization is always performed against the internal LDAP.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="whenlogginginthroughapis">When logging in through APIs</h2>

  <p>When you log in to Edge through the an API, only the credentials entered with the API are
  used. Unlike with UI login, a separate login with system admin credentials is not needed.</p>

  <p>The following API login steps are illustrated in Figure 2:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The user enters login credentials in the login UI.</li>
    <li>The credentials entered by the user are authenticated and authorized.</li>
    <li>If external authentication is enabled, the credentials are authenticated against the
      external LDAP, otherwise, the internal Edge LDAP is used.</li>
    <li>Authorization is always performed against the internal LDAP.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following image shows authorization and authentication through the Edge APIs:</p>
