  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> These instructions are only for installing the portal.</aside>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Do not install Developer Channel Services portal on the same
  servers as Apigee Edge.</aside>

  <p>Before you install, ensure that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You install Postgres before installing the portal. You can either install Postgres as part
    of installing Edge, or install Postgres standalone for use by the portal.

      <ul>
        <li>If you install Postgres standalone, it can be on the same node as the portal.</li>

        <li>If you are connecting to Postgres installed as part of Edge, and Postgres is configured
        in master/standby mode, specify the IP address of the master Postgres server. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>You are performing the install on the 64-bit version of a supported version of Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Oracle. See the list of supported versions at
    <a href="/release/supported-software">Supported software and supported versions</a>. </li>

    <li>Yum is installed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="installationoverview">Installation overview</h2>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Do not install Developer Channel Services portal on the same
  servers as Apigee Edge.</aside>

  <p>After you install the Edge the <code>apigee-setup</code> utility on a node, use that
  utility to install the portal on the node. The <code>apigee-setup</code> utility has the form:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo /opt/apigee/apigee-setup/bin/setup.sh -p <var>component</var> -f <var>configFile</var></pre>

  <p>Pass a configuration file to the <code>apigee-setup</code> utility that contains the
  information about the installation. If the configuration file is missing any required
  information, the <code>apigee-setup</code>
  utility prompts you to enter it on the command line.</p>

  <p>The only requirement is that the configuration file must be accessible or readable by the
  "apigee" user.  </p>

  <p>For example, use the following command to install the portal:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo /opt/apigee/apigee-setup/bin/setup.sh -p dp -f <var>myConfig</var></pre>

  <p>See <a href="install-edge-apigee-setup-utility">Install the Edge apigee-setup utility</a>
  for more.</p>

  <h2 id="deprecationofthesmtpsslproperty">Deprecation of the SMTPSSL property </h2>

  <p>In previous releases, you used the <code>SMTPSSL</code> property to
  set the protocol used by the SMTP server connected to the portal. That property has been
  deprecated.</p>

  <p>You now use the <code>SMTP_PROTOCOL</code> property,
  instead of the <code>SMTPSSL</code> property, to set the
  protocol used by the SMTP server connected to the portal. The valid values are: "standard",
  "ssl", or "tls".</p>

  <h2 id="creatingaconfigurationfile">Creating a configuration file</h2>

  <p>Shown below is an example silent configuration file for a portal installation. Edit this file
  as necessary for your configuration. Use the -f option to <code>setup.sh</code> to include this
  file.</p>

  <h2 id="1testyourconnectiontoapigeeedge">1. Test your connection to Apigee Edge</h2>

  <p>Test your connection to the Edge management server by executing the following cURL command
  from a command prompt on the portal server:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u {<var>EMAIL</var>}:{<var>PASSWORD</var>} http://&lt;ms_ip_or_DNS&gt;:8080/v1/organizations/{<var>ORGNAME</var>}</pre>

  <p>Where <var>EMAIL</var> and <var>PASSWORD</var> are the email
  address and password of the administrator for <var>ORGNAME</var>.</p>

  <p>Make sure to specify the hostname and port number specific to your installation of Edge. Port
  8080 is the default port used by Edge. If you are connecting to an organization in the cloud,
  then the request URL is: <code>https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/<var>ORGNAME</var></code>.</p>

  <p>If successful, this command returns a response similar to the following:</p>

  <p>Remove the PHP packages using the following command:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">yum remove <var>package-name</var></pre>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To remove PHP on CentOS 6.6, you might also have to remove
  Ganglia, if it is installed.</aside>

  <h2 id="3installpostgres">3. Install Postgres</h2>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Do not install Developer Channel Services portal on the same
  servers as Apigee Edge.</aside>

  <p>The portal requires Postgres to be installed before you can install the portal. You can either
  install Postgres as part of installing Edge, or install Postgres standalone for use by the
  portal. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you are connecting to Postgres installed as part of Edge, and Postgres is configured in
    master/standby mode, specify the IP address of the master Postgres server. </li>
    <li>If you install Postgres standalone, it can be on the same node as the portal.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For information on installing Postgres as part of installing Edge, see
  <a href="install-edge-components-node">Install Edge components on a node</a>.</p>

  <p>To install Postgres standalone:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install the Edge <code>apigee-setup</code> utility on the node using the
    internet or non-internet procedure. See
    <a href="install-edge-apigee-setup-utility">Install the Edge apigee-setup utility</a> for more.</li>

    <li>Create a config file for Postgres, as shown below:
    <pre class="prettyprint"># Must resolve to IP address or DNS
    name of host - not to 127.0.0.1 or localhost.
    HOSTIP=$(hostname -i)

    # The pod and region of Postgres. Use the default values shown below.
    MP_POD=gateway
    REGION=dc-1

    # Set the Postgres password. The default value is 'postgres'.
    PG_PWD=postgres</pre></li>

    <li>At the command prompt, run the setup script to install Postgres:
      <pre  class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-setup/bin/setup.sh -p pdb -f <var>configFile</var></pre>
      <p>The <code>-p pdb</code> option specifies to install Postgre. The configuration file must
      be accessible or readable by the "apigee" user.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="4installtheportal">4. Install the portal </h2>

  <p>To install the portal:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install the Edge <code>apigee-setup</code> utility on
      the node using the internet or non-internet procedure. See
      <a href="install-edge-apigee-setup-utility">Install the Edge apigee-setup utility</a> for
      more. </li>
    <li>Ensure that you have installed Postgres, either Postgres standalone or as part of
      installing Edge.</li>
    <li>At the command prompt, run the setup script:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-setup/bin/setup.sh -p dp -f <var>configFile</var></pre>
      <p>The <code>-p dp</code> option specifies to install the portal.
      <p>The configuration file must be accessible or readable by the "apigee" user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to the portal home page at <code>http://localhost:8079</code> or to the DNS name of
    your portal.</li>
    <li>Log in to the portal using the administrator credentials that you set in the config file to
    ensure that the portal is running properly. </li>
    <li>Select <strong>Reports &gt; Status Report</strong> in the Drupal menu to ensure
    that you can see the current status of the portal.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="5ensurethattheupdatemanagermoduleisenabled">5. Ensure that the Update manager module is
  enabled</h2>

  <p>To receive notifications of Drupal updates, ensure that the Drupal Update manager module is
  enabled. From the Drupal menu, select <strong>Modules</strong> and scroll down to the
  <strong>Update manager</strong> module. If it is not enabled, enable it. </p>

  <p>Once enabled, you can see the available updates by using the <strong>Reports &gt; Available
  Updates</strong> menu item. You can also use the following Drush command:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">drush pm-info update</pre>

  <p>You have to run this command from the root directory of the site. By default, the Developer
  Portal is installed at <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code>. Therefore,
  you should first change directory to <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-drupal/wwwroot</code> before
  running the command. If you did not install the portal in the default directory, change to your
  installation directory.</p>

  <p>Use the <strong>Reports &gt; Available Updates &gt; Settings</strong> menu item to configure
  the module to email you when updates are available and to set the frequency for checking for
  updates.</p>

  <h2 id="6configuretheapachesolrsearchengineoptional">6. Configure the Apache Solr search engine
  (Optional)</h2>

  <p>By default, the Drupal modules that connect to the Apache Solr search engine are disabled when
  you install the portal. Most portals use the internal Drupal search engine, and therefore do not
  require the Drupal Solr modules. </p>

  <p>If you decide to use Solr as your search engine, you must install Solr locally on your server
  and then enable and configure the Drupal Solr modules on the portal. </p>

  <p>To enable the Drupal Solr modules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Modules</strong> in the Drupal menu.</li>
    <li>Enable the <strong>Apache Solr Framework</strong> module and the <strong>Apache Solr
      Search</strong> module.</li>
    <li>Save your changes.</li>
    <li>Configure Solr as described at
    <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1999280" class="external">https://drupal.org/node/1999280</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="7installsmartdocsoptional">7. Install SmartDocs (Optional)</h2>

  <p>SmartDocs lets you document your APIs on the Developer Services portal in a way that makes the
  API documentation fully interactive. However, to use SmartDocs with the portal, you must first
  install SmartDocs on Edge.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you are connecting the portal to an Edge Cloud installation, SmartDocs is already
    installed and no further configuration is necessary.</li>

    <li>If you are connecting the portal to an Edge for Private Cloud installation, you must ensure
    that SmartDocs is installed on Edge. For more on installing Edge and SmartDocs, see
    <a href="install-smartdocs">Install SmartDocs</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You must also enable SmartDocs on the portal. For more information on SmartDocs, see
  <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/using-smartdocs-document-apis">Using SmartDocs to document
  APIs</a>. </p>

  <h2 id="8configurethejqueryupdatemodulefornoninternetinstallationsoptional">8. Configure the
  JQuery Update module for non-internet installations (Optional)</h2>

  <p>If you install and use the JQuery Update module in a non-internet installation, you need to
  configure the module to use the local version of JQuery. If you configure the module to use a CDN
  for a non-internet installation, it will attempt to access the CDN and cause delays with page
  loading. For more information about the JQuery Update module see
  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update">https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update</a>.</p>

  <p>To configure the JQuery Update module to use the local version of JQuery:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Configuration &gt; Development &gt; JQuery Update</strong> in the Drupal menu.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Performance</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
    <li>In the JQuery and JQuery UI CDN drop-down select <b>None</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="9whatnext">9. What next?</h2>

  <p>Your next steps after you install the Developer Services portal are to configure and customize
  it for your specific requirements. The documentation on the Apigee web site contains all of the
  information on configuring, styling, and managing a portal. Access the documentation at
  <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/what-developer-portal">http://apigee.com/docs/developer-services/content/what-developer-portal</a>.</p>
