          <p>As part of the installation process, the installer downloads resources from the web.
          If your environment is set up to proxy outgoing HTTP and HTTPS requests, then your proxy
          must be configured to correctly handle redirected requests that might occur during a
          download.</p>
          <p>For example, a request to <code>https://drupal.org/</code> returns an HTTP
          301 status code and redirects to <code>https://www.drupal.org/</code>.</p>
          <p>Your proxy should be configured to return an HTTP 200 status code with the requested
          content from the redirect.</p>
          <p>For SAP installations, if your environment is set up to proxy outgoing HTTPS requests,
          then your proxy must support TLSv1.0. OpenSSL 0.9.8 does not support TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2,
          only TLSv1.0.</p>

  <h2 id="redhatenterpriselinuxrhelrequirements">Red Hat Enterprise Linux requirements </h2>

  <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) has extra requirements due to a subscription needed to access
  software downloads from Red Hat. The server must be able to connect to the Internet to download
  RPMs via yum. If using RHEL, the server must be registered on the Red Hat Network (RHN) and
  registered to the server optional channel.</p>

  <p>The Red Hat requirements are checked during the install and the portal installer prompts you
  if RHEL is not already registered. If you already have Red Hat login credentials, you can use the
  following command to register RHEL before beginning the installation process:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">subscription-manager register --username=<var>username</var> --password=<var>password</var> --auto-attach </pre>

  <p>Where <var>username</var> and <var>password</var> are your Red Hat credentials.</p>

  <p>If you have a trial version of RHEL, you can obtain a 30-day trial license. See
  <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/32790" class="external">https://access.redhat.com/solutions/32790</a>
  for more information.</p>

<!--<h2>SUSE Enterprise Linux Server Requirements</h2>
<div class="note">
        <p>Non-networked installation is not supported for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server at this time.</p>
</div>
<p>On SUSE 12 and above, you need to have the following extensions and modules enabled:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
        <li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Web and Scripting Module &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The extensions and modules can be installed during server installation or by using the YaST tool after the server is installed.</p>-->

  <h2 id="smtprequirements">SMTP requirements</h2>

  <p>Apigee recommends, but does not require, that you configure an SMTP server to send email
  messages from the portal. If configured, you must ensure that Drupal can access the
  necessary port on the SMTP server. For non-TLS SMTP, the port number is typically 25. For
  TLS-enabled SMTP, it is often 465, but check with your SMTP provider.</p>

  <h2 id="additionalrequirements">Additional requirements</h2>

  <p>To perform the installation, you must have root access.</p>

  <h2 id="deploymentarchitecturerequirements">Deployment architecture requirements</h2>

  <p>The portal has a single interface with the Apigee Management Server via a REST
  API in order to store and retrieve information about a user's applications. The portal must be
  able to connect to the Management Server via HTTP or HTTPS, depending on your installation.</p>


  <p><img alt="" src="/private-cloud/images/portal-requirements.png"></p>

  <h2 id="informationrequiredbeforeyoustarttheinstall">Information required before you start the
  install</h2>

  <p>Before starting the install, you must have the following information available:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Which platform are you configuring: Red Hat or CentOS? If this is a Red Hat install, the
      machine must be registered on the Red Hat Network to download RPMs.</li>
    <li>Do you plan on installing Postgres on the local machine? If you want a simple install with
      everything on the same machine, then install Postgres locally.</li>
    <li>If you intend to access a remote Postgres server, get the following information about the
      Postgres server:
      <ul>
        <li>hostname</li>
        <li>port</li>
        <li>database name</li>
        <li>username</li>
        <li>password</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The remote Postgres server should already be configured before you start the
      installation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is the fully-qualified domain name of the web server? (This information will be added
      to /etc/hosts.) This should be an IP address or hostname, such as <code>portalserver.example.com</code>.
      The default value is <code>localhost</code>.</li>
    <li>There are three pieces of information that allow your portal to communicate with the Apigee
      Edge management server. This information is as follows:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>URL of the Apigee Management API Endpoint</strong>: This will be either a
          hostname or an IP address. This is the REST endpoint to which all calls are made to create
          apps and register developers for app keys. The default endpoint is
          <code>https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1</code>.
          <p>For an Edge for Private Cloud installation, the URL is in the form:</p>
          <pre>http://<var>Edge_IP</var>:8080/v1</pre>
          <p>or:</p>
          <pre>https://<var>Edge_IP:SSL_port</var>/v1</pre>
          <p>Where <var>Edge_IP</var> is the IP address of the Edge management server and
          <var>SSL_port</var> is the SSL port for the Edge management API. For example, 8443.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Apigee Organization name</strong>: There is a relationship between portals and
          Apigee Edge organizations. You will set up the default organization when you set up the
          Management API Endpoint. The default value is my-org.</li>
        <li><strong>Username and password for the management API endpoint</strong>: The calls from
          the portal to Edge must be performed by an administrator for your organization.
          <p>This username/password is for an administrator on your organization and should be used only
          for connecting to Edge from the portal. For example, if you specify the credentials of a
          user, and that user is ever deleted on Edge, then the portal will no longer be able to
          connect to Edge. Therefore, create an administrator on your organization just for this
          connection.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre>dc_devportal+ORGNAME@apigee.com:MyP@ssw0rd</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
