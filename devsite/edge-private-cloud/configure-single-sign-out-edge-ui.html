{% block title %}Configure single sign-out from the Edge UI{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

  <p>By default, when a user logs out of the Edge UI, the Edge UI clears any cookies for the user's
  session. Clearing cookies requires the user to log in again the next time they want to access the
  Edge UI. If you have implemented a single sign-on environment, the user can still access any
  other services through their single sign-on credentials.</p>

  <p>However, you might want a logout from any one service to sign the user out of all services. In
  this case, you can configure your IDP to support single sign-out.</p>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You do not have to make configuration changes to the Edge UI to
  enable single sign-out. You configure the IDP to sign out the user when they log out of any
  service. Therefore, this steps to enable single sign-out are specific to your IDP.</aside>

  <p>To configure the IDP, you need the following information about the Edge UI:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The single logout URL for the Edge UI</strong>: This URL is in the form:
      <pre>http://<var>apigee_sso_IP_DNS</var>:9099/saml/SingleLogout/alias/apigee-saml-login-opdk</pre>
      <p>Or, if you enabled TLS on <code>apigee-sso</code>:
      <pre>https://<var>apigee_sso_IP_DNS</var>:9099/saml/SingleLogout/alias/apigee-saml-login-opdk</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The service provider issuer</strong>: The value for the Edge UI is
      <code>apigee-saml-login-opdk</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>The SAML IDP cert</strong>: In
      <a href="install-and-configure-edge-sso">Install and configure Edge SSO</a>, you created a
      SAML IDP certificate named <code>selfsigned.crt</code> and saved it in
      <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/apigee-sso/saml/</code>. Depending on your IDP, you
      must use that same cert to configure single sign-out.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, if you are using OKTA as your service provider, in the SAML settings for you
  application:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In your OKTA application, select <strong>Show Advanced Settings</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Allow application to initiate Single Logout</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>Single Logout URL</strong> for the Edge UI as shown above.</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>SP Issuer</strong> (service provider issuer).</li>
    <li>In <strong>Signature Certificate</strong>, upload the
      <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/apigee-sso/saml/selfsigned.crt</code> TLS cert. The
      following image shows this information for OKTA:
      <p><img alt="" src="/private-cloud/images/okta_single_logout.png"></p>
    </li>
    <li>Save your settings.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When a user next logs out of the Edge UI, the user is logged out of all services.</p>
