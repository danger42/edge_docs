  <h2 id="fourlettercommands">Four-letter commands</h2>

  <p>Apache ZooKeeper has a number of "four-letter commands" that can be helpful in determining the
  current status of ZooKeeper voter and observer nodes.  These commands can be invoked using
  <code>nc</code>, <code>telnet</code> or another utility that has the ability to send commands to a
  specific port.  Details on the four-letter commands can be found in the
  <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands" class="external">Apache ZooKeeper commands reference</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="removingoldsnapshotfiles">Removing old snapshot files</h2>

  <p>Apache ZooKeeper automatically performs periodic maintenance to remove old snapshot files
  which accumulate as updates to the system are made. The following settings in
  <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg</code> control this process:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">## The number of snapshots to retain in dataDir:
autopurge.snapRetainCount=5

# Purge task interval in hours.
# Set to "0" to disable auto purge feature.
autopurge.purgeInterval=120</pre>

  <p>To set these properties to different values:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Edit <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/zookeeper.properties</code>
      to set the following properties. If that file does not exist, create it.</li>
    <li>Set the following properties in <code>zookeeper.properties</code>:
      <pre class="prettyprint"># Set the snapshot count. In this example set it to 10:
  conf_zoo_autopurge.snapretaincount=10

  # Set the purge interval. In this example, set is to 240 hours:
  conf_zoo_autopurge.purgeinterval=240</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure the file is owned by the "apigee" user:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">chown apigee:apigee /opt/apigee/customer/application/zookeeper.properties</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Restart ZooKeeper by using the command:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service apigee-zookeeper restart</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="logfilemaintenance">Log file maintenance</h2>

  <p>Apache Zookeeper log files are kept in <code>/opt/apigee/var/log/apache-zookeeper</code>. Normally, log
  file maintenance should not be required, but if you find that there are an excessive number of
  ZooKeeper logs or that the logs are very large you can modify ZooKeeper's log4j properties
  to set the maximum file size and file count.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Edit <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/zookeeper.properties</code> to set the
      following properties. If that file does not exist, create it.</li>
    <li>Set the following properties in <code>zookeeper.properties</code>:
      <pre class="prettyprint">conf_log4j_log4j.appender.rollingfile.maxfilesize=10MB
# max file size
conf_log4j_log4j.appender.rollingfile.maxbackupindex=50 # max open files</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure the file is owned by the "apigee" user:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">chown apigee:apigee /opt/apigee/customer/application/zookeeper.properties</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Restart ZooKeeper by using the command:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service apigee-zookeeper restart</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
