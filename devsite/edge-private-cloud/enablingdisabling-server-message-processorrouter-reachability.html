{% block body %}

  <p>It is a good practice to disable reachability on a server during maintenance, such
  as for a server restart or upgrade. When reachability is disabled, no traffic is directed to the
  server. For example, when reachability is disabled on a Message Processor, Routers will not
  direct any traffic to that Message Processor.</p>

  <p>For example, to upgrade a Message Processor, you can use the following procedure:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Disable reachability on the Message Processor.</li>
    <li>Upgrade the Message Processor.</li>
    <li>Enable reachability on the Message Processor.</li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In some configurations there may be a number of Routers behind a
  Load Balancer (ELB). The ELB might be configured to monitor port 15999 on the Routers. If the
  load balancer cannot access port 15999 on the Router it assumes the Router is down and you can
  restart the Router.</aside>

  <h2 id="disablingenablingreachabilityonamessageprocessor">Disabling/enabling reachability on
  a Message Processor</h2>

  <p>To disable reachability on Message Processor, you can just stop the
  Message Processor:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-message-processor stop</pre>

  <p>The Message Processor first processes any pending messages before it shuts down. Any new
  requests are routed to other available Message Processors.</p>

  <p>To restart the Message Processor, use the following commands:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-message-processor start
<code class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-message-processor wait_for_ready</code></pre>

  <p>The <code>wait_for_ready</code> command returns the following message when the Message
  Processor is ready to process messages:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">Checking if message-processor is up: message-processor is up.</pre>

  <h2 id="disablingenablingreachabilityonarouter">Disabling/enabling reachability on a
  Router</h2>

  <p>In a production environment, you typically have a load balancer in front of the Edge Routers.
  Load balancers monitor port 15999 on the Routers to ensure that the Route is available.</p>

  <p>Configure the load balancer to perform an HTTP or TCP health check on the Router using the
  following URL:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">http://<var>router_IP</var>:15999/v1/servers/self/reachable</pre>

  <p>This URL returns an HTTP 200 response code if the Router is reachable.</p>

  <p>To make a Router unreachable, you can block port 15999 on the Router. If the load balancer is
  unable to access the Router on port 15999 it no longer forwards requests to the Router. For
  example, you can block the port by using the following iptables command on the Router node:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 15999 -j REJECT</pre>

  <p>To later make the Router available, flush iptables:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo iptables -F</pre>

  <p>You might be using iptables to manage other ports on the node so you have to take that into
  consideration when you flush iptables or use iptables to block port 15999. If you are using
  iptables for other rules, you can use the -D option to reverse the specific change:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo iptables -D INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 15999 -j REJECT</pre>

  <aside class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> As an alternative to checking reachability on the Router on port 15999, you can
    check the port on individual virtual hosts. For example, if you have a virtual host on port
    9001, make a TCP check on that port. To make that port unreachable, you can use the following
    iptables command:
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --syn --dport 9001 -j REJECT</pre>
  </aside>

  <h2 id="checkingthestatusofrouterormessageprocessor">Checking the status of Router or Message
  Processor</h2>

  <p>To get the status of a Router, make a request to port 8081 on the Router:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -v http://<var>router_IP</var>:8081/v1/servers/self/up</pre>

  <p>If the Router is up, the request returns "true" in the response and HTTP 200. Note that this
  call only checks if the Router is up and running. Control of the Router's reachability from a
  load balancer is determinedby port 15999</p>

  <p>To get the status of a Message Processor:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl http://<var>Message_Processor_IP</var>:8082/v1/servers/self/up</pre>
