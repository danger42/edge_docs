          <p>As part of the installation process, the installer downloads resources from the web.
          If your environment is set up to proxy outgoing HTTP and HTTPS requests, then your proxy
          must be configured to correctly handle redirected requests that might occur during a
          download.</p>

          <p>For example, a request to <span style=
          "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">https://drupal.org/</span> returns an HTTP
          301 status code and redirects to <span style=
          "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">https://www.drupal.org/</span>.</p>

          <p>Your proxy should be configured to return an HTTP 200 status code with the requested
          content from the redirect.</p>

          <p>For SAP installations, if your environment is set up to proxy outgoing HTTPS requests,
          then your proxy must support TLSv1.0. OpenSSL 0.9.8 does not support TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2,
          only TLSv1.0.</p>

  <h2 id="redhatenterpriselinuxrhelrequirements">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
  Requirements </h2>

  <p>RHEL has extra requirements due to a subscription needed to access software downloads from Red
  Hat. The server must be able to connect to the Internet to download RPMs via yum. If using RHEL,
  the server must be registered on the Red Hat Network (RHN) and registered to the server optional
  channel. </p>

  <p>The Red Hat requirements are checked during the install and the portal installer prompts you
  if RHEL is not already registered. If you already have Red Hat login credentials, you can use the
  following command to register RHEL before beginning the installation process:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&gt; subscription-manager register --username=<em><strong>my_username</strong></em> --password=<em><strong>my_password</strong></em> --auto-attach 
</pre>

  <p>Replace <em><strong>my_username</strong></em> and <em><strong>my_password</strong></em> with
  your Red Hat credentials.</p>

  <p>If you have a trial version of RHEL, you can obtain a 30-day trial license. See <a href=
  "https://access.redhat.com/solutions/32790">https://access.redhat.com/solutions/32790</a> for
  more information.</p><!--<h2>SUSE Enterprise Linux Server Requirements</h2>
<div class="note">
        <p>Non-networked installation is not supported for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server at this time.</p>
</div>
<p>On SUSE 12 and above, you need to have the following extensions and modules enabled:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
        <li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Web and Scripting Module &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The extensions and modules can be installed during server installation or by using the YaST tool after the server is installed.</p>-->

  <h2 id="smtprequirements">SMTP requirements</h2>

  <p>Apigee recommends, but does not require, that you configure an SMTP server to send email
  messages from the portal. If configured, you must ensure that the Drupal can access the
  necessary port on the SMTP server. For non-TLS SMTP, the port number is typically 25. For
  TLS-enabled SMTP, it is often 465, but check with your SMTP provider. </p>

  <h2 id="additionalrequirements">Additional Requirements </h2>

  <p>In order to perform the installation, the user installing the software must have root
  access. </p>

  <h2 id="deploymentarchitecturerequirements">Deployment Architecture Requirements </h2>

  <p>Developer Channel Services has a single interface with the Apigee Management Server via a REST
  API in order to store and retrieve information about a user&#8217;s applications. Developer
  Channel Services will need to be able to connect to the Management Server via HTTP or HTTPS,
  depending on your installation. </p>

  <h2 id="informationrequiredbeforeyoustarttheinstall">Information Required Before You Start the
  Install</h2>

  <p>Before starting the install, you must have the following information available:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Which platform are you configuring: Red Hat or CentOS? If this is a Red Hat install, the
    machine must be registered on the Red Hat Network to download RPMs.</li>

    <li>Do you plan on installing Postgres on the local machine? If this is the case, do not
    install Postgres locally. If you want a simple install with everything on the same machine,
    then install Postgres locally.</li>

    <li>If you intend to access a remote Postgres server, the hostname, port, database name,
    username, and password of the remote Postgres server. The remote Postgres server should already
    be configured before you start the installation.</li>

    <li>What is the fully-qualified domain name of the web server? (This information will be added
    to /etc/hosts.) This should be an IP address or hostname, such as <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">portalserver.example.com</span>. The default value
    is <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">localhost</span>.</li>

    <li>There are three pieces of information that allow your portal to communicate with the Apigee
    Edge management server. This information is as follows:

      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha outside">
        <li><strong>URL of the Apigee Management API Endpoint</strong>: This will be either a
        hostname or an IP address. This is the REST endpoint to which all calls are made to create
        apps and register developers for app keys. The default endpoint is <span style=
        "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1</span>. <br>

        <br>
        For an Edge for Private Cloud installation, the URL is in the form: <br>
        <span style=
        "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">http://<em><strong>EdgeIp</strong></em>:8080/v1</span><br>

        <br>
        or:<br>
        <span style=
        "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">https://<em><strong>EdgeIp:SSLport</strong></em>/v1</span><br>

        <br>
        Where <em><strong>EdgeIp</strong></em> is the IP address of the Edge management server and
        <em><strong>SSLport</strong></em> is the SSL port for the Edge management API. For example,
        8443. </li>

        <li><strong>Apigee Organization name</strong>: There is a relationship between portals and
        Apigee Edge organizations. You will set up the default organization when you set up the
        Management API Endpoint. The default value is my-org.</li>

        <li><strong>Username and password for the management API endpoint</strong>: The calls from
        the portal to Edge must be performed by an administrator for your organization. <br>
        <br>
        This username/password is for an administrator on your organization and should be used only
        for connecting to Edge from the portal. For example, if you specify the credentials of a
        user, and that user is ever deleted on Edge, then the portal will no longer be able to
        connect to Edge. Therefore, create an administrator on your organization just for this
        connection. <br>
        <br>
        For example:<br>
        <span style=
        "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">dc_devportal+ORGNAME@apigee.com:MyP@ssw0rd</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
