  <p>This section describes the backup and restore tasks in an on-premises installation of Apigee
  Edge. It is recommended that you should always create a backup of Apigee Edge components, i.e.
  configuration and data, at regular intervals and ensure that recovery is performed in an event of
  a system failure. Backup and restore procedures enable you to restore the state of an entire
  system (including all components), without affecting other parts of the system.</p>

  <h2 id="whattobackup">What to Backup</h2>

  <p>In an on-premises deployment of Apigee Edge, you must backup the following Edge
  components:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Apache ZooKeeper (apigee-zookeeper)</li>
    <li>Apache Cassandra (apigee-cassandra)</li>
    <li>Postgres Server (edge-postgres-server)</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL database (apigee-postgresql)
      <aside class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In a Postgres Master/Standby configuration, you only
      backup the Master. You do not have to backup the slave.</aside>
    </li>
    <li>Qpid Server (edge-qpid-server)</li>
    <li>Qpidd (apigee-qpidd)</li>
    <li>OpenLDAP (apigee-openldap)</li>
    <li>Management Server (edge-management-server)</li>
    <li>Message Processor (edge-message-processor)</li>
    <li>Router (edge-router)</li>
    <li>Edge UI (edge-ui)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="recoverytimeobjectivertovsrecoverypointobjectiverpo">Recovery time objective (RTO) vs.
  Recovery point objective (RPO)</h2>

  <p>The RTO is the duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be
  restored after a disaster (or disruption) in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated
  with a break in business continuity.</p>

  <p>A RPO is the maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a
  major incident. Both objectives must be taken into consideration before you implement a backup
  plan for your recovery strategy.</p>

  <h2 id="beforeyoustartusefulfacts">Before You Start: Useful Facts</h2>

  <p>You may observe that installation data is distributed across several systems, for example
  organizations are in LDAP, ZooKeeper and Cassandra. Make sure that you take care of the following
  notes about backup and restore:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have multiple Cassandra nodes, back them up one at a time. </li>

    <li>If you have multiple ZooKeeper nodes, back them up one at a time. The backup process
    temporarily shuts down ZooKeeper.</li>

    <li>If you have multiple Postgres nodes, back them up one at a time. </li>

    <li>You can back up all other Edge components at the same time on all nodes by using tools such
    as Ansible or Chef.</li>

    <li>When you restore one of ZooKeeper, Cassandra or LDAP nodes it is recommended to restore all
    three nodes in order to achieve consistency (especially when organizations/environments have
    been created since backup was created).<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The above does not affect restoration of one Cassandra or ZooKeeper node
    in a datastore cluster, since no backup is used.</li>

    <li>If LDAP or global administrator passwords are lost/corrupted, a complete backup is required
    in order to get the same credentials for the last backup and running system.</li>

    <li>The backup utility writes the generated backup file to
    <code>/opt/apigee/backup/<var>comp</var></code> where <var>comp</var> is
    the name of the component. Because you can generate many backup files, and because these files
    can get large, you can mount a separate disk at <code>/opt/apigee/backup</code> just
    for backup files.</li>

    <li>All backup files, except for PostreSQL, are named in the form:
      <pre>backup-(<var>year</var>).(<var>month</var>).(<var>day</var>),(<var>hour</var>).(<var>min</var>).(<var>seconds</var>).tar.gz </pre>
      <p>PostreSQL backup files are named:
      <pre>(<var>year</var>).(<var>month</var>).(<var>day</var>),(<var>hour</var>).(<var>min</var>).(<var>seconds</var>).dump</pre>
     </li>
  </ul>
