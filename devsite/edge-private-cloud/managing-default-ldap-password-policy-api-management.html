{% block title %}Managing the default LDAP password policy for API management{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

  <p>The Apigee system uses OpenLDAP to authenticate users in your API management environment.
  OpenLDAP makes this LDAP password policy functionality available. </p>

  <p>This section describes how to configure the delivered default LDAP password policy. Use this
  password policy to configure various password authentication options, such as the number of
  consecutive failed login attempts after which a password can no longer be used to authenticate a
  user to the directory.</p>

  <p>This section also describes how to use a couple of APIs to unlock user accounts that have been
  locked according to attributes configured in the default password policy.</p>

  <h2 id="configuringthedefaultldappasswordpolicy">Configuring the Default LDAP Password
  Policy</h2>

  <p>To configure the default LDAP password policy:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Connect to your LDAP server using an LDAP client, such as Apache Studio or ldapmodify. By
      default OpenLDAP server listens on port 10389 on the OpenLDAP node.
      <p>To connect, specify the Bind DN or user of <code>cn=manager,dc=apigee,dc=com</code> and the
      OpenLDAP password that you set at the time of Edge installation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Use the client to navigate to the password policy attributes for:
      <ul>
        <li>Edge users: <code>cn=default,ou=pwpolicies,dc=apigee,dc=com</code></li>
        <li>Edge sysadmin: <code>cn=sysadmin,ou=pwpolicies,dc=apigee,dc=com</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Edit the password policy attribute values as desired.</li>
    <li>Save the configuration.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="unlockingauseraccount">Unlocking a User Account</h2>

  <p>A user's account may be locked due to attributes set in the password policy. A user with
  the sysadmin Apigee role assigned can use the following API call to unlock the user's
  account. Replace <var>userEmail</var>, <var>adminEmail</var>, and <var>password</var> with actual
  values.</p>

  <p><strong>To unlock a user:</strong></p>
  <pre>/v1/users/<var>userEmail</var>/status?action=unlock -X POST -u <var>adminEmail</var>:<var>password</var></pre>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> To ensure that only system administrators can call this API, the
    <code>/users/*/status</code> path is included in the
    <code>conf_security_rbac.restricted.resources</code> property for the Management Server:
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">cd /opt/apigee/edge-management-server</pre>
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">grep -ri "conf_security_rbac.restricted.resources" *</pre>

    <p>The output contains the following:</p>
