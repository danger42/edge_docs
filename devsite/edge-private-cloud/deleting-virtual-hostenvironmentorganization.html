  <p>This section explains the removal of organizations, environments, and virtual hosts. Note that
  the order of API calls is very important&#8211; that means, for example, the step to remove an
  organization can only be executed after you remove all associated environments in the
  organization.</p>

  <h2 id="deleteavirtualhost">Delete a Virtual Host</h2>

  <p>Before you can delete a virtual host from an environment, you must update any API proxies that
  reference the virtual host to remove the reference. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/virtual-hosts">Virtual hosts</a> for more. </p>

  <p>Use the following API to delete a virtual host:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u &lt;admin user&gt;:&lt;admin passwd&gt; -X DELETE \
  "http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>/environments/<var>env_name</var>/virtualhosts/<var>virtualhost_name</var>"</pre>

  <h2 id="deleteanenvironment">Delete an Environment</h2>

  <p>You can only delete an environment after you have:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Deleted all virtual hosts in the environment as described above.</li>
    <li>Disassociated the environment from all Message Processors.</li>
    <li>Cleaned up analytics.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="deleteanenvironment-disassociateanenvironmentfrommessageprocessor">Disassociate an
  Environment from Message Processor</h3>

  <p>Use the following API to remove an association of an environment with a Message Processor. If
  you want to delete the environment, you must disassociate it from all Message Processors:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -u <var>ADMIN_USERNAME</var>:<var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var> -X POST \
  "http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>/environments/<var>env_name</var>/servers" \
  -d "action=remove&amp;uuid=<var>uuid</var>"</pre>

  <p>Where <var>uuid</var> is the UUID of Message Processor.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> To retrieve the UUID of the Message Processor, run the following
  command:</aside>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl http://<var>mp_IP</var>:8082/v1/servers/self</pre>

  <p>Where <var>mp_IP</var> is the IP address of the Message Processor.</p>

  <h3 id="deleteanenvironment-cleanupanalytics">Cleanup analytics</h3>

  <p>Remove analytics information about the organization:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u <var>ADMIN_EMAIL</var>:<var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var> -X DELETE \
http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/analytics/groups/ax/<var>analytics_group</var>/scopes?org=<var>org_name</var>&amp;env=<var>env_name</var></pre>

  <p>Where <var>analytics_group</var> defaults to "analytics-001".</p>

  <p>If you are unsure of the name of the analytics group, use the following command to display
  it:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">apigee-adminapi.sh analytics groups list --admin <var>ADMIN_EMAIL</var> --pwd <var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var> --host localhost</pre>

  <p>This command returns the analytics group name in the <code>name</code> field.</p>

  <h3 id="deleteanenvironment-deletetheenvironment">Delete the environment</h3>

  <p>Use the following API to delete an environment:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u <var>ADMIN_EMAIL</var>:<var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var> \
  http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>/environments/<var>env_name</var> \ -X DELETE</pre>

  <h2 id="deleteanorganization">Delete an Organization</h2>

  <p>You can only delete an organization after you have:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Deleted all virtual hosts in all environments in the organization as described above.</li>
    <li>Deleted all environments in the organization as described above.</li>
    <li>Disassociated the organization from all pods.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="deleteanorganization-disassociateanorganizationfrompod">Disassociate an Organization from
  Pod</h3>

  <p>Use the following API to delete disassociate an organization from a pod:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -u <var>ADMIN_EMAIL</var>:<var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var> -X POST \
  "http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>/pods" \
  -d "action=remove&amp;region=<var>region_name</var>&amp;pod=<var>pod_name</var>"</pre>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> To find out what region and pods an organization is associated
  with, run the following command:</aside>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u <var>ADMIN_EMAIL</var>:<var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var>  \
  "http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>/pods"</pre>

  <h3 id="deleteanorganization-deletetheorganization">Delete the organization</h3>

  <p>Use the following API to delete an organization:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u <var>ADMIN_EMAIL</var>:<var>ADMIN_PASSWORD</var> -X DELETE \
  "http://<var>ms_IP</var>:8080/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>"</pre>
