            <p>** The Postgres hard disk value is based on the out of the box analytics captured by Edge.
            If you add custom values to the analytics data, then these values should be increased
            accordingly. Use the following formula to estimate the required storage:</p>
            <p><code><strong>bytes of storage needed =</strong><br/><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(# bytes of analytics data/request) *<br/><br/>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;(days/month) *<br/><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(months of data retention)</code></p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p><code>(2K bytes) * (100 req/sec) * (3600 secs/hr) * (18 peak hours/day) * (30 days/month) * (3 months retention)<br/><br/>
                                  <strong>= 1,194,393,600,000 bytes or 1194.4 GB of storage needed</strong></code></p>

      <li>If the root file system is not large enough for the installation, Apigee recommendeds
        that you place the data onto a larger disk.</li>
      <li>If an older version of Apigee Edge for Private Cloud was installed on the machine, ensure
        that you delete the <code>/tmp/java</code> directory before a new installation.</li>
      <li>The system-wide temporary folder <code>/tmp</code> needs execute permissions in order to
        start Cassandra.</li>
      <li>If user 'apigee' was created prior to the installation, ensure that
      <code>/home/apigee</code> exists as home directory and is owned by
      <code>apigee:apigee</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <h2 id="operatingsystemandthirdpartysoftwarerequirements">Operating system and third-party
  software requirements</h2>

  <p>These installation instructions and the supplied installation files have been tested on the
  operating systems and third-party software listed in
  <a href="/release/supported-software">Supported software and supported versions</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="creatingtheapigeeuser">Creating the 'apigee' user</h2>

  <p>The installation procedure creates a Unix system user named 'apigee'. Edge directories and
  files are owned by 'apigee', as are Edge processes. That means Edge components run as the
  'apigee' user. if necessary, you can run components as a different user.</p>

  <h2 id="installationdirectory">Installation directory</h2>

  <p>By default, the installer writes all files to the <code>/opt/apigee</code> directory. You
  cannot change this directory location. While you cannot change this directory, you can create a
  symlink to map <code>/opt/apigee</code> to another location, as described in
  <a href="#symlink">Creating a symlink from /opt/apigee</a>.</p>

  <p>In the instructions in this guide, the installation directory is noted as
  <code>/opt/apigee</code>.</p>

  <h3 id="symlink">Creating a symlink from /opt/apigee</h3>

  <p>Before you create the symlink, you must first create a user and group named "apigee". This is
  the same group and user created by the Edge installer.</p>

  <p>To create the symlink, perform these steps before downloading the bootstrap_{{cur_version}}.sh file.
  You must perform all of these steps as root:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create the "apigee" user and group:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">groupadd -r apigee &gt; useradd -r -g apigee -d /opt/apigee -s /sbin/nologin -c "Apigee platform user" apigee</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Create a symlink from <code>/opt/apigee</code> to your desired install root:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">ln -Ts <var>/srv/myInstallDir</var> /opt/apigee</pre>
      <p>Where <var>/srv/myInstallDir</var> is the desired location of the Edge files.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Change ownership of the install root and symlink to the "apigee" user:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">chown -h apigee:apigee <var>/srv/myInstallDir</var> /opt/apigee</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="java">Java</h2>

  <p>You need a supported version of Java 1.8 installed on each machine prior to the installation.
  Supported JDKs are listed in
  <a href="/release/supported-software">Supported software and supported versions</a>.</p>

  <p>Ensure that the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable points to the root of the JDK for
  the user performing the installation.</p>

  <h2 id="selinux">SELinux</h2>

  <p>Depending on your settings for SELinux, Edge can encounter issues with installing and starting
  Edge components. If necessary, you can disable SELinux or set it to permissive mode during
  installation, and then re-enable it after installation. See <a href=
  "install-edge-apigee-setup-utility">Install the Edge apigee-setup utility</a> for more.</p>

  <h2 id="networksetting">Network setting</h2>

  <p>Apigee recommendeds that you check the network setting prior to the installation. The installer
  expects that all machines have fixed IP addresses. Use the following commands to validate the
  setting:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>hostname</code> returns the name of the machine</li>
    <li><code>hostname -i</code> returns the IP address for the hostname that can be addressed from
    other machines.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Depending on your operating system type and version, you may need to edit
  <code>/etc/hosts</code> and <code>/etc/sysconfig/network</code> if the hostname is not
  set correctly. See the documentation for your specific operating system for more information.</p>

  <p>If a server has multiple interface cards, the "hostname -i" command returns a space-separated
  list of IP addresses. By default, the Edge installer uses the first IP address returned, which
  might not be correct in all situations. As an alternative, you can set the following property in
  the installation configuration file:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">ENABLE_DYNAMIC_HOSTIP=y</pre>

  <p>With that property set to "y", the installer prompts you to select the IP address to use as
  part of the install. The default value is "n". See
  <a href="edge-configuration-file-reference">Edge Configuration File Reference</a> for more.</p>

  <aside class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you set <code>ENABLE_DYNAMIC_HOSTIP=y</code>,
  ensure that your property file does not set <code>HOSTIP</code>.</aside>

  <h3 id="networksetting-tcpwrappers">TCP Wrappers</h3>

  <p>TCP Wrappers can block communication of some ports and can affect OpenLDAP, Postgres, and
  Cassandra installation. On those nodes, check <code>/etc/hosts.allow</code> and
  <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> to ensure that there are no port restrictions on the required
  OpenLDAP, Postgres, and Cassandra ports.</p>

  <h3 id="networksetting-iptables">iptables</h3>

  <p>Validate that there are no iptables policies preventing connectivity between nodes on the
  required Edge ports. If necessary, you can stop iptables during installation using the
  command:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">sudo/etc/init.d/iptables stop</pre>

  <p>On CentOS 7.x:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">systemctl stop firewalld</pre>

  <h2 id="ensureedgeroutercanaccessetcrcdinitdfunctions">Ensure Edge Router can
  access /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</h2>

  <p>The Edge Router uses the Nginx router and require read access
  to <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</code>.</p>

  <p>If your security process requires you to set permissions on
  <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</code>, do not set them to 700 or else the router will fail to
  start. Permissions can be set to 744 to allow read access to
  <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="cassandra">Cassandra </h2>

  <p>All Cassandra nodes must be connected to a ring. Cassandra stores data replicas on
  multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. The replication strategy for each
  Edge keyspace determines the Cassandra nodes where replicas are placed. For more, see
  <a href="about-cassandra-replication-factor-and-consistency-level">About Cassandra
  replication factor and consistency level</a>.</p>

  <p>Cassandra automatically adjusts its Java heap size based on the available memory. For more, see
  <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/operations/ops_tune_jvm_c.html" class="external">Tuning
  Java resources</a> in the event of a performance degradation or high memory consumption.</p>

  <p>After installing the Edge for Private Cloud, you can check that Cassandra is configured
  correctly by examining the <code>/opt/apigee/apigee-cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml</code>
  file. For example, ensure that the Edge for Private Cloud installation script set the following
  properties:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>cluster_name</code></li>
    <li><code>initial_token</code></li>
    <li><code>partitioner</code></li>
    <li><code>seeds</code></li>
    <li><code>listen_address</code></li>
    <li><code>rpc_address</code></li>
    <li><code>snitch</code></li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Do not edit the cassandra.yaml file.</aside>

  <h2 id="postgresqldatabase">PostgreSQL database</h2>

  <p>After you install Edge, you can adjust the following PostgreSQL database settings based on the
  amount of RAM available on your system:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">conf_postgresql_shared_buffers = 35% of RAM      # min 128kB
conf_postgresql_effective_cache_size = 45% of RAM
conf_postgresql_work_mem = 512MB       # min 64kB</pre>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These settings assume that the PostgreSQL database is
  only used for Edge analytics, and not for any other purpose.</aside>

  <p>To set these values:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Edit the postgresql.properties file:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">vi /opt/apigee/customer/application/postgresql.properties</pre>
      <p>If the file does not exist, create it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Set the properties listed above.</li>
    <li>Save your edits.</li>
    <li>Restart the PostgreSQL database:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service apigee-postgresql restart</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="systemlimits">System limits</h2>

  <p>Ensure that you have set the following system limits on Cassandra and Message Processor
  nodes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>On Cassandra nodes, set soft and hard memlock, nofile, and address space (as) limits for
    installation user (default is "apigee") in <code>/etc/security/limits.d/90-apigee-edge-limits.conf</code>
    as shown below:
    <pre class="prettyprint">apigee soft memlock unlimited
apigee hard memlock unlimited
apigee soft nofile 32768
apigee hard nofile 65536
apigee soft as unlimited
apigee hard as unlimited</pre>
    </li>
    <li>On Message Processor nodes, set the maximum number of open file descriptors to 64K
      in <code>/etc/security/limits.d/90-apigee-edge-limits.conf</code> as shown below:
      <pre class="prettyprint">apigee soft nofile 32768
apigee hard nofile 65536</pre>
      <p>If necessary, you can raise that limit. For example, if you have a large number of
      temporary files open at any one time.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="networksecurityservicesnss">Network Security Services (NSS)</h2>

  <p>Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries that supports development of
  security-enabled client and server applications. You should ensure that you have installed NSS
  v3.19, or later.</p>

  <p>To check your current version:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">yum info nss</pre>

  <p>To update NSS:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">yum update nss</pre>

  <p>See <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1981.html" class="external">this article</a>
  from RedHat for more information.</p>

  <h2 id="disablednslookuponipv6whenusingnscdnameservicecachedaemon">Disable DNS lookup on IPv6
  when using NSCD (Name Service Cache Daemon)</h2>

  <p>If you have installed and enabled NSCD (Name Service Cache Daemon), the Message Processors
  make two DNS lookups: one for IPv4 and one for IPv6. You should disable DNS lookup on IPv6 when
  using NSCD.</p>

  <p>To disable the DNS lookup on IPv6:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>On every Message Processor node, edit <code>/etc/nscd.conf</code></li>
    <li>Set the following property:
      <pre class="prettyprint">enable-cache hosts no</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="disableipv6ongooglecloudplatformforredhatcentos7">Disable IPv6 on Google Cloud
  Platform for RedHat/CentOS 7</h2>

  <p>If you are installing Edge on RedHat 7 or CentOS 7 on Google Cloud Platform, then you
  must disable IPv6 on all Qpid nodes.</p>

  <p>See the RedHat or CentOS documentation of your specific OS version for instructions on
  disabling IPv6. For example, you can:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <code>/etc/hosts</code> in an editor.</li>
    <li>Insert a "#" character in column one of the following line to comment it out:
      <pre>#::1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Save the file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="awsami">AWS AMI</h2>

  <p>If you are installing Edge on an AWS Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  7.x, you must first run the following command:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-extras rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional</pre>

  <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

  <p>The installer uses the following UNIX tools in the standard version as provided by EL5 or
  EL6.</p>

  <h3>ntpdate</h3>

  <p>Apigee recommends that your servers' times are synchronized. If not already configured,
  the <code>ntpdate</code> utility could serve this purpose, which verifies
  whether servers are time synchronized. You can use <code>yum install ntp</code> to install the
  utility. This is particularly useful for replicating OpenLDAP setups. Note that you set up server
  time zone in UTC.</p>

  <h3>openldap 2.4</h3>
  <p>The on-premises installation requires OpenLDAP 2.4. If your server has an Internet connection,
  then the Edge install script downloads and installs
  OpenLDAP. If your server does not have an Internet connection, you must ensure that OpenLDAP is
  already installed before running the Edge install script. On RHEL/CentOS, you can run
  <code>yum install openldap-clients openldap-servers</code> to install the OpenLDAP.</p>

  <p>For 13-host installations, and 12-host installations with two data centers,  OpenLDAP
  replication is required because there are multiple nodes hosting OpenLDAP.</p>

  <h2 id="firewallsandvirtualhosts">Firewalls and virtual hosts</h2>

  <p>The term <code>virtual</code> commonly gets overloaded in the IT arena, and so it is with an
  Apigee Edge for Private Cloud deployment and virtual hosts. To clarify, there are two primary
  uses of the term <code>virtual</code>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Virtual machines (VM)</strong>: Not required, but some deployment use VM technology
      to create isolated servers for their Apigee components. VM hosts, like physical hosts, can have
      network interfaces and firewalls.</li>
    <li><strong>Virtual hosts</strong>: Web endpoints, analogous to an Apache virtual host.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A router in a VM can expose multiple virtual hosts (as long as they differ from one another in
  their host alias or in their interface port).</p>

  <p>Just as a naming example, a single physical server <code>A</code> might be running two VMs,
  named "VM1" and "VM2". Let's assume "VM1" exposes a virtual Ethernet interface, which gets named
  "eth0" inside the VM, and which is assigned IP address <code>111.111.111.111</code> by
  the virtualization machinery or a network DHCP server; and then assume VM2 exposes a virtual
  Ethernet interface also named "eth0" and it gets assigned an IP address
  <code>111.111.111.222</code>.</p>

  <p>We might have an Apigee router running in each of the two VMs. The routers expose virtual host
  endpoints as in this hypothetical example:</p>

  <p>The Apigee router in VM1 exposes three virtual hosts on its eth0 interface (which has some
  specific IP address), <code>api.mycompany.com:80</code>, <code>api.mycompany.com:443</code>, and
  <code>test.mycompany.com:80</code>.</p>

  <p>The router in VM2 exposes <code>api.mycompany.com:80</code> (same name and port as exposed by
  VM1).</p>

  <p>The physical host's operating system might have a network firewall; if so, that firewall
  must be configured to pass TCP traffic bound for the ports being exposed on the virtualized
  interfaces (<code>111.111.111.111:{80, 443}</code> and <code>111.111.111.222:80</code>). In
  addition, each VM's operating system may provide its own firewall on its eth0 interface and these
  too must allow ports 80 and 443 traffic to connect.</p>

  <p>The basepath is the third component involved in routing API calls to different API proxies
  that you may have deployed. API proxy bundles can share an endpoint if they have different
  basepaths. For example, one basepath can be defined as <code>http://api.mycompany.com:80/</code>
  and another defined as <code>http://api.mycompany.com:80/salesdemo</code>.</p>

  <p>In this case, you need a load balancer or traffic director of some kind splitting the
  http://api.mycompany.com:80/ traffic between the two IP addresses
  (<code>111.111.111.111</code> on VM1 and <code>111.111.111.222</code> on VM2). This function is
  specific to your particular installation, and is configured by your local networking group.</p>

  <p>The basepath is set when you deploy an API. From the above example, you can deploy two APIs,
  <code>mycompany</code> and <code>testmycompany</code>, for the organization
  <code>mycompany-org</code> with the virtual host that has the host alias of
  <code>api.mycompany.com</code> and the port set to <code>80</code>. If you do not declare a
  basepath in the deployment, then the router does not know which API to send incoming requests
  to.</p>

  <p>However, if you deploy the API <code>testmycompany</code> with the base URL of
  <code>/salesdemo</code>, then users access that API using
  <code>http://api.mycompany.com:80/salesdemo</code>. If you deploy your API mycompany with the
  base URL of <code>/</code> then your users access the API by the URL
  <code>http://api.mycompany.com:80/</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>

  <p>Each installation of Edge requires a unique license file that you obtain from Apigee. You will
  need to provide the path to the license file when installing the management server, for example
  /tmp/license.txt.</p>

  <p>The installer copies the license file to
  <code>/opt/apigee/customer/conf/license.txt</code>.</p>

  <p>If license file is valid, the management server validates the expiry and allowed Message
  Processor (MP) count. If any of the license settings is expired, you can find the logs in the
  following location: <code>/opt/apigee/var/log/edge-management-server/logs</code>.
  In this case you can contact {{support}} for migration details.</p>

  <p>If you do not yet have a license, contact {{sales}}.</p>
