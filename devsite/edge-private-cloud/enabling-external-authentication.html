  <p>This section explains how to obtain, install, and configure the components required to
  integrate an external LDAP service into Apigee Edge for user authentication.</p>

  <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>You must have an Apigee Edge for Private Cloud 4.18.05 installation.</li>
    <li>You must have global system administrator credentials on Apigee Edge for Private Cloud to
      perform this installation.</li>
    <li>You need to know the root directory of your Apigee Edge for Private Cloud installation. The
      default root directory is <code>/opt</code>.</li>
    <li>You must add your <strong>Edge global system administrator credentials</strong> to the
      external LDAP. Remember that by default, the sysadmin credentials are stored in the Edge
      internal LDAP. Once you switch to the <strong>external</strong> LDAP, your sysadmin credentials
      will be authenticated there instead. Therefore, you must provision the credentials to the
      external system <strong>before</strong> enabling external authentication in Edge.
      <p>For example if you have configured and installed Apigee Edge for Private Cloud with global
      system administrator credentials as:</p>
      <pre>username: edgeuser@mydomain.com
password: Secret123</pre>
      <p>Then the user <code>edgeuser@mydomain.com</code> with password
      <code>Secret123</code> must also be present in the external LDAP.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If you are running a Management Server cluster, note that you must perform all of the steps
      in this document for each Management Server.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="configuringexternalauthentication">Configuring external authentication</h2>

  <p>The main activity you'll perform is configuring the <code>management-server.properties</code> file.
  This activity includes stopping and starting the Edge Management Server, deciding whether you
  want to use direct or indirect binding, encrypting sensitive credentials, and other related
  tasks.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Important</strong>: Decide now whether you intend to use the indirect or direct
      binding authentication method. This decision will affect some aspects of the configuration. See
      <a href="external-authentication-configuration-overview">External Authentication</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Important</strong>: You must do these config steps on each Apigee Edge Management
      Server (if you are running more than one).</li>
    <li>Open <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/management-server.properties</code>
      in a text editor. If the file does not exist, create it.</li>
    <li>Add the following line:
      <pre>conf_security_authentication.user.store=externalized.authentication</pre>
      <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure that there are no trailing spaces at the end
      of the line.</aside>
      <p>This line adds the external authentication feature to your Edge for Private Cloud
      installation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To make this step easy, we have created two well-commented <strong>sample configurations --
      one for direct and one for indirect binding authentication</strong>. See the samples below for
      the binding you wish to use, and complete the configuration:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#configuringexternalauthentication-directbindingconfigurationsample">DIRECT BINDING configuration sample</a></li>
        <li><a href="#configuringexternalauthentication-indirectbindingconfigurationsample">INDIRECT BINDING configuration sample</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Restart the Management Server:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-management-server restart</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Verify that the server is running:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all status</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Important</strong>: You must do an additional configuration under either (or both)
      of the following circumstances:
      <ol>
        <li>If you intend to have users log in using usernames that are
          not email addresses. In this case, your sysadmin user must also authenticate with a
          username.</p>
          <p><strong>AND/OR</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>If the password for your sysadmin user account in your external
          LDAP is different from the password you configured when you first installed Apigee Edge for
          Private Cloud. See <a href="additional-configuration-required-event-different-sysadmin-credentials">Configuration required for different sysadmin credentials</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="testingtheinstallation">Testing the installation</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Verify that the server is running:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-all status</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Execute this command, providing a set of <strong>Apigee Edge global system admin
      credentials</strong>. The API call we're going to test can only be executed by an Edge
      sysadmin.
      <aside class="key-point"><strong>Important</strong>: The identical credentials must exist in your external LDAP account.
      If not, you need to add them now. Note that the username is usually an email address; however,
      it depends on how you have configured external authentication, as explained previously in this
      document.</aside>
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -v http://<var>management-server-IP</var>:8080/v1/o -u <var>sysadmin_username</var></pre>

      <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -v http://192.168.52.100:8080/v1/o -u jdoe@mydomain.com</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Enter your password when prompted.
      <p>If the command returns a 200 status and a list of organizations, the configuration is correct.
      This command verifies that the API call to the Edge Management Server was successfully
      authenticated through the external LDAP system.</p>
