<!-- based on notes from J -->

<p>This section describes processes and procedures that you should <em>not</em> do. While the
items described here are generally not best, or even good, practices, there may be times when
performing such tasks is required. They are provided here for your edification.</p>

<h4>Mixing prod and non-prod</h4>
<p>Don't install prod with non-prod in the same planet</p>

<h4>Backups and repairs</h4>
<p>Disable {{am}} before running any backups or repairs</p>
<p>Don't run backups when repairs are running</p>

<h4>Tokens</h4>
<p>Don't create long-lived refresh tokens and short lived access tokens associated with the long
lived refresh tokens (we don't have a solution for OPDK yet for CPS)</p>

See /api-platform/system-administration/auth-tools

<h4>Data Center downtime</h4>
<p>If you plan downtime on the network between data centers, disable jobs like repairs and
backups</p>
