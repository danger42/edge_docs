    <title>Verify API Key Policy Error Codes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned and fault variables that are set by Edge when this policy triggers an error.
    This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to
  handle faults. To learn more, see <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/what-you-need-know-about-policy-errors.html">What you need to know
  about policy errors</a> and <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/fault-handling.html">Handling
  faults</a>.</p>

  <h3>Runtime errors</h3>

  <p>These errors can occur when the policy executes.</p>
    <aside class="key-point">Use <u><a href="/api-monitoring">API Monitoring</a></u> to investigate fault codes and diagnose issues faster.</aside>

        <td>401</td>

        <td>The Company associated with the Developer App that has the API key you are using has an
        inactive status. When a Company's status is set to inactive,  you cannot access the
        developers or apps associated with that Company. An org admin can change a Company's status
        using the management API. See <a href=

          an inactive status. When an App Developer's status is set to inactive, any Developer Apps
          created by that developer are deactivated. An admin user with appropriate permissions
          (such as Organization Administrator) can change a developer's status in the following
          ways:</p>

        access any API products and cannot invoke any API managed by Apigee Edge. An org admin can
        change the status of a Developer App using the management API. See <a href=

        <td>401</td>

        <td>An API key was received by Edge, but it is invalid. When Edge looks up the key in its
        database, it must exactly match the on that was sent in the request. If the API worked
        previously, make sure the key was not regenerated. If the key was regenerated, you will see
        this error if you try to use the old key. For details, see <a href=

        approved key in the Developer App associated with your API proxy through a Product.</td>

  <h3> </h3>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Currently Edge does not report the
  <code>ApiKeyNotApproved</code> error accurately. Instead, if a key is not approved (its status is
  set to "revoked" or "pending"), you will get the FailedToResolveAPIKey error instead. For more
  information and a possible workaround, see <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/questions/25203/verify-api-key-not-reporting-api-key-not-approved.html">
  this post on the Apigee Community</a>. </aside>

  <h3>Deployment errors</h3>

  <p>These errors can occur when you deploy a proxy containing this policy.</p>

    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" width="271">Error name</th>

        <td>The <code>&lt;APIKey&gt;</code> element does not have a value or key specified.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  

  <h3>Fault variables</h3>

  <p>These variables are set when a runtime error occurs. For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/what-you-need-know-about-policy-errors.html">What you need to know
  about policy errors</a>.</p>

  <h3>Example error responses</h3>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> For error handling, the best practice is to trap the
  <code>errorcode</code> part of the error response. Do not rely on the text in the
  <code>faultstring</code>, because it could change.</aside>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{  
   "fault":{  
      "faultstring":"Invalid ApiKey",
      "detail":{

      }

         "errorcode":"keymanagement.service.DeveloperStatusNotActive"
      },

  <h3>Example fault rule</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;FaultRule name="FailedToResolveAPIKey"&gt;
    &lt;Step&gt;
