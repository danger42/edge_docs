          <p>The value of the Base Path in your API proxy configuration. The base path is the URI
          fragment that follows the host in the URL. Conditional flow URIs follow the base
          path.</p>
          <p>In the URL "http://myorg-test.apigee.net<strong>/v2/weatherapi</strong>/forecastrss?w=12797282":
          <ul>
            <li>Host is "myorg-test.apigee.net" (which includes the
          organization name and environment)</li>
            <li>Base path is "/v2/weatherapi"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The only way you'd know this
          is by looking at the API proxy definition or checking the value of the proxy.basepath
          variable. The proxy path suffix follows the base path ("/forecastrss"), along with any
          query parameters.</p>
          <p>If you define a dynamic Base Path in your API proxy
          configuration, such as "/v2/*/weatherapi", then this variable is set to the dynamic path
          ("/v2/*/weatherapi"), even though the base path resolves to a static value, such as
          "/v2/foo/weatherapi".</p>

          <p>The basepath is defined as the path component that uniquely identifies the API proxy.
          The public-facing URL of an API proxy is comprised of your organization name, the
          environment where the proxy is deployed, the basepath, the basepath suffix, and any query
          parameters. </p>
          <p>For example, in a request to <code>http://myorg-test.apigee.net/v2/weatherapi/forecastrss?w=12797282</code>,
          the basepath suffix is "/forecastrss".</p>
