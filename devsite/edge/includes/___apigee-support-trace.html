<p>
By default, Apigee Edge allows Apigee Support to use the Trace tool on your API proxies to provide
  support. You may disable this option at any time. However, disabling  this option may limit
  Apigee Support's ability to provide you with support.

<p>
To disable Apigee Support from using the Trace tool:
</p><ol>
<li>Log in to the new Edge UI at <a href="https://apigee.com/edge" target="_blank">https://apigee.com/edge</a>.
<li>Select <strong>Admin > Privacy &amp; Security</strong> in the left navigation bar.
<li>Click the <strong>Enable Apigee Support</strong> <strong>to Trace</strong> toggle to disable
  use of the Trace tool by Apigee Support.</li></ol>
<aside class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: This option is <strong>enabled</strong> by default. When you disable or
  re-enable this option, the user name and date are saved and displayed adjacent to the toggle.</aside>
