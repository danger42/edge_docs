  <p>If the message includes the words <strong>traffic cannot flow</strong>, it means that the

  partial deployment).</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-forcloudcustomerschecktheapigeestatuspageforoutages">For Cloud customers,
  check the Apigee status page for outages</h3>

  <p>Deployment errors can occur when there is an outage in Edge for the Cloud. Use the following
  URL to check the current Edge status to see if there is an outage:  <a href=
  "https://status.apigee.com/">https://status.apigee.com</a></p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-forceundeployandredeploy">Force undeploy and redeploy</h3>

  <p>In some cases, undeploying and redeploying the proxy revision will correct the problem. Apigee
  recommends that you do a forced undeploy using the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/revisions/%7Brevision_number%7D/deployments">
  Deployments</a> API with the parameter force=true. If the forced undeploy works, try redeploying
  the proxy. If the problem persists, contact <a href="https://support.apigee.com">Apigee
  Support</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-checkthedeploymentstatusofyourproxy">Check the deployment status of your
  proxy</h3>Use the <a href=
  "/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/environments/%7Benv_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/deployments">
  Deployments</a> API to check the deployment status of your proxy to the Message Processors and
  routers in your environment and include the response information when you contact <a href=
  "https://support.apigee.com">Apigee Support</a> or post your issue on the <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/index.html">Apigee Community</a>. See also <a href=
