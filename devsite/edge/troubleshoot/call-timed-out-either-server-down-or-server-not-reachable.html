  <h2 id="errortext">Error text</h2>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
<strong>Error in deployment for environment test.</strong>
The revision is deployed, but traffic cannot flow. Call timed out; either server is down or server is not reachable
</pre>

  <p>If the message includes the words <strong>traffic cannot flow</strong>, it means that the
  proxy could not be deployed to ANY available <a href=
  "/private-cloud/latest/overview#onpremisesdeployment">Message Processors</a> or <a href=
  "/private-cloud/latest/overview#onpremisesdeployment">Routers</a>.</p>

  <p>If the message says <strong>traffic can flow, but flow may be impaired</strong>, it means the
  proxy might have been deployed to some, but not to all available Message Processors or Routers (a
  partial deployment).</p>

  <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

  <p>The proxy deployment failed because of a time out. There are two typical causes for this
  error:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p dir=""><strong>Network connectivity issue:</strong> Communication failed between the
      <a href="/private-cloud/latest/overview#onpremisesdeployment">Management Server</a> and
      Message Processor. The underlying cause can be related to network connectivity issues or
      firewall rules.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Large API proxy bundle:</strong> A Message Processor may take a long time to
      activate if the API proxy bundle is large in size, leading to remote procedure call (RPC)
      timeouts.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>

  <p>In the Edge UI, you will see an error message when you try to deploy a proxy:</p>

  <p>If you are on <strong>Edge Public Cloud</strong>, you may need expert help from Apigee to
  resolve this error. However, you can try the steps outlined in the <a href=

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-forcloudcustomerschecktheapigeestatuspageforoutages">For Cloud customers,
  check the Apigee status page for outages</h3>

  <p><strong>Deployment errors</strong> can occur when there is an outage in Edge for the Cloud.
  Use the following URL to check the current Edge status to see if there is an outage:
   <a href="https://status.apigee.com/">https://status.apigee.com</a></p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-forceundeployandredeploy">Force undeploy and redeploy</h3>

  <p>In some cases, undeploying and redeploying the proxy revision will correct the problem. Apigee
  recommends that you do a <strong>forced undeploy</strong> using the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/revisions/%7Brevision_number%7D/deployments">
  Deployments</a> API with the parameter <strong>force=true</strong>. If the forced undeploy works,
  try redeploying the proxy.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-createanewproxyrevision">Create a new proxy revision</h3>

  <p>If undeploy/redeploy does not work, try deploying the proxy as a new revision. Sometimes if
  you delete certain policies from a proxy and then redeploy as the same revision, you can get a
  deployment error. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/deploy/deploying-proxies-ui.html#deploymentoptions-aboutrevisions">About
  revisions</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-checkthedeploymentstatusofyourproxy">Check the deployment status of your
  proxy</h3>

  <p>Use the <a href=
  "/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/environments/%7Benv_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/deployments">
  Deployments</a> API to check the deployment status of your proxy to the Message Processors and
  routers in your environment. This step can indicate the source of the problem. For example, it
  will show you which Message Processors have errors.</p>

  <p>If necessary, you can always include the response information when you contact <a href=
  "https://support.apigee.com">Apigee Support</a> or post your issue on the <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/index.html">Apigee Community</a>. See also <a href=

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-createanddeployasimplepassthroughproxy">Create and deploy a simple
  pass-through proxy</h3>

  <p>Create a "hello world" proxy and deploy it. If it deploys successfully, then there might be a
  problem with the size of the API proxy bundle that's not deploying properly. See the next section
  <a href=
  "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfb58dA6B2E3OHdll2lmkFcbeaTfD26NqRUxkKhn7XI/edit#heading=h.p463q6kv5z0j">
  Move resource files to the Environment or Organization level</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-moveresourcefilestotheenvironmentororganizationlevel">Move resource files
  to the Environment or Organization level</h3>

  <p>If you're on Public Cloud, you can try this solution if you suspect you have an unusually
  large proxy bundle. If you're on Private Cloud, additional troubleshooting steps are described in
  <a href="https://docs-apis.apigee.io/files/ApigeeEdgeTroubleshootingGuide.pdf">Edge Public Cloud
  Troubleshooting Guide</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, if you're deploying a proxy with a Java Callout and the Java code includes a
  large number of JAR files, it's possible your proxy is exceeding a size limit (by default 15
  Mb).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Move any resource files, such as NodeJS Script files and modules, JavaScript files, or JAR
      files to the environment or organization level. For more information on resource files, see
      <a href="/api-platform/develop/resource-files.html">Resource files</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Deploy the API proxy and see if the error goes away.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>{% endblock %}
