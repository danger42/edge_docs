  <h2 id="errortext">Error text</h2>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
<strong>Error in deployment for environment test.</strong>
The revision is deployed and traffic can flow, but flow may be impaired. Unexpected error occurred while processing updates.
</pre>

  <p>If the message includes the words <strong>traffic cannot flow</strong>, it means that the
  proxy could not be deployed to ANY available <a href=
  "/private-cloud/latest/overview#onpremisesdeployment">Message Processors</a> or <a href=
  "/private-cloud/latest/overview#onpremisesdeployment">Routers</a>.</p>

  <p>If the message says <strong>traffic can flow, but flow may be impaired</strong>, it means the
  proxy might have been deployed to some, but not to all available Message Processors or Routers (a
  partial deployment).</p>

  <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

  <p>There are two typical causes for this error:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Message Processor is out of memory:</strong> A Message Processor ran out of Java
      heap space resulting in the deployment failure.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Error in the API proxy bundle:</strong> Usually this means there is a problem with
      the API proxy bundle that you are deploying and the problem is interfering with the
      deployment. Sometimes a misconfigured policy, target server, or other proxy entity. You may
      be able to diagnose and fix this problem yourself. See <a href="#hasanythingchanged">Has
      anything changed?</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the Edge UI, you will see an error message when you try to deploy a proxy:</p>

  <p>If you are on <strong>Edge Public Cloud</strong>, you may need expert help from Apigee to
  resolve this error. However, you can try the steps outlined in the <a href=
  "#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section below before contacting <a href=

  <h2 id="troubleshooting"><a id="troubleshooting" name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-forcloudcustomerschecktheapigeestatuspageforoutages">For Cloud customers,
  check the Apigee status page for outages</h3>

  <p>Deployment errors can occur when there is an outage in Edge for the Cloud. Use the following
  URL to check the current Edge status to see if there is an outage:  <a href=
  "https://status.apigee.com/">https://status.apigee.com</a></p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-forceundeployandredeploy">Force undeploy and redeploy</h3>

  <p>In some cases, undeploying and redeploying the proxy revision will correct the problem. Apigee
  recommends that you do a forced undeploy using the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/revisions/%7Brevision_number%7D/deployments">
  Deployments</a> API with the parameter <strong>force=true</strong>. If the <strong>forced
  undeploy</strong> works, try redeploying the proxy.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-createanewproxyrevision">Create a new proxy revision</h3>

  <p>If undeploy/redeploy does not work, try deploying the proxy as a new revision. Sometimes if
  you delete certain policies from a proxy and then redeploy as the same revision, you can get a
  deployment error. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/deploy/deploying-proxies-ui.html#deploymentoptions-aboutrevisions">About
  revisions</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-checkthedeploymentstatusofyourproxy">Check the deployment status of your
  proxy</h3>

  <p>Use the <a href=
  "/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/environments/%7Benv_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/deployments">
  Deployments</a> API to check the deployment status of your proxy to the Message Processors and
  routers in your environment. This step can indicate the source of the problem. For example, it'll
  show you which Message Processors or routers have errors.</p>

  <p>If necessary, you can always include the response information when you contact <a href=
  "https://support.apigee.com">Apigee Support</a> or post your issue on the <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/index.html">Apigee Community</a>. See also <a href=
  "/troubleshoot/what-include-if-you-contact-tech-support-or-community.html">What to include when
  you contact Tech Support or the Community</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-createanddeployasimplepassthroughproxy">Create and deploy a simple
  pass-through proxy</h3>

  <p>Create a "hello world" proxy and deploy it. If it deploys successfully, then it's possible the
  root of the problem is a misconfiguration in the proxy that will not deploy. See the next
  section, <a href="#hasanythingchanged">Has anything changed?</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="troubleshooting-hasanythingchanged"><a id="hasanythingchanged" name=
  "hasanythingchanged"></a>Has anything changed?</h3>

  <p>There could be a problem with the proxy bundle that you are deploying. It could be that a
  policy is misconfigured or you're deploying a Java Callout that does not include one or more
  dependencies. If you're using Node.js, check the <a href=
  "/api-platform/nodejs/debugging-nodejs-proxies.html#viewingnodejslogs">Node.js logs</a> to see if
  there were any errors.</p>

  <p>Consider if anything changed recently. If you use a source control system, try diffing the
  source files between the current failing proxy and a version that you know worked. For
  example:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Look at the <a href="/api-platform/debug/view-api-history.html">API Proxy History</a> in
      the UI. This will show you the last revision that deployed successfully.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>In source control, diff the current revision against the last revision that deployed
      successfully. This may give you an idea of what changed and provide troubleshooting
      clues.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>{% endblock %}
