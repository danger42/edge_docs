  <h2 id="usingthetracetool">Using the Trace tool</h2>

  <p>Trace helps you pinpoint where errors occur, examine flow variables, debug proxy flows, and
  more.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html">Using the trace tool</a> - Trace
    also lets you view the call as a cURL command, which lets you see the HTTP headers and message
    payload in a single place. Great for debugging.</li>

    <li><a href="/api-platform/debug/using-offline-trace-tool.html">Using the offline trace
    tool</a> - You can download an XML file of the trace results for viewing offline. The file
    shows the complete details of the listening session including the contents of all headers,
    variables and policies.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html#refiningmessagecaptureusingfilters">Filtering
    trace results</a> - Limit the trace to only calls that contain a specific header or query
    parameter. This is a good way of helping you troubleshoot issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="viewinganalyticsandhistory">Viewing analytics and history</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/api-platform/analytics/using-performance-metrics.html">Analytics
    services</a> - Analytics Services is a valuable tool that you can use to troubleshoot
    problems. For example, if your API goes down, analytics charts can help illustrate whether the
    failure was sudden or involved a slow lead-in time.</li>

    <li><a href="/api-platform/debug/view-api-history.html">Product and organization
    history</a> - Apigee Edge provides a "history" feature that can be helpful in
    troubleshooting problems as well as managing API usage.</li>
  </ul>
