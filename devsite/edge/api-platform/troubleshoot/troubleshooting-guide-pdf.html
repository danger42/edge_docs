  <p>The
  <a href="/files/ApigeeEdgeTroubleshootingGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Apigee
  Edge Private Cloud Troubleshooting Guide (PDF)</a> is intended to help you diagnose and solve many kinds of
    problems that can occur on Edge Private Cloud without having to call Apigee Support.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The contents of the Edge Private Cloud Troubleshooting Guide PDF version
  are being revised and
  moved into the <a href="/api-platform/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-introduction">set of playbooks</a> on the Apigee doc site. At some time in the future, the PDF
  version will
  be removed.</p>

  <p>The target audience for this guide comprises developers who are working with Apigee Edge for
  the Private Cloud release 4.17.01 or higher, as well as support or administration personnel who
  maintain infrastructure and datastores associated with Edge.</p>

  <p>This document is intended for Apigee Private Cloud users with a high-level understanding of
    Apigee Edge and its
  architecture, as well as some understanding of basic Edge concepts such as policies, analytics,
  monetization, and datastores such as Cassandra and Postgres. In addition, it is assumed that the
  reader is reasonably proficient with the operating system where Edge is installed.</p>
