  <h2 id="symptom">Symptom</h2>

  <p>The client application receives an HTTP response status
    <strong>503</strong> with the message <strong>Service Unavailable</strong> following
an API proxy call.</p>

  <h2 id="error-messages">Error messages</h2>

<p>You can see one of the following error messages:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
</pre>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable: Back-end server is at capacity
</pre>

  <p>You can also see this error message in the HTTP response:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "fault": {
      "faultstring": "The Service is temporarily unavailable", 
      "detail": {
           "errorcode": "messaging.adaptors.http.flow.ServiceUnavailable"
       }
    }
}
</pre>

  <h2 id="northbound-and-southbound-connection">Possible causes</h2>

  <p>The HTTP status code 503 means that the server is currently unavailable. On Apigee Edge,
    this problem can occur either at the <a href="https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/troubleshoot/runtime/503-service-unavailable.html#determiningthesourceoftheproblem-understandingnorthboundandsouthboundconnections">incoming (northbound)</a>
    or <a href="https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/troubleshoot/runtime/503-service-unavailable.html#determiningthesourceoftheproblem-understandingnorthboundandsouthboundconnections">outgoing (southbound)</a> connection.
    Most often, the error occurs because a server is too busy or is
    down for some reason, such as for
    temporarily maintenance. It can also occur if the <a href="#SSLHandshakeFailures">TLS/SSL handshake fails</a>
    between the client and the server.</p>

  <p>Possible causes for the <strong>503 Service Unavailable</strong> response are:</p>

  <h3 id="overloadedserver-diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>


  <p>To diagose this issue, try to determine if the error occurs on
  the incoming (northbound) or outgoing (southbound) connection. To learn how to make
    this determination, see <a href="#determinesourceofproblem">Determining the source of the problem</a>.</p>

     <p>If the error is on the incoming (northbound) connection:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Private Cloud users</strong>: Check if the Average Load/CPU/Memory usage is high on
      the Edge Router.</li>

      <li><strong>Public Cloud users</strong>: You do not have access to the Edge Router. Contact
      <a href="https://support.apigee.com/">Apigee Support</a> for assistance.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>If the error is on the outgoing (southbound) connection:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>All users</strong>: Check if the Average Load/CPU/Memory usage is high on the
    backend server.</li>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

  <p>If the <strong>Edge Router</strong> is overloaded:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Private Cloud users</strong>: Restart the Edge Router and then monitor its usage to
    see if the problem is resolved. If the problem persists, contact <a href=
    "https://support.apigee.com/">Apigee Support</a> for assistance.</li>

    <li><strong>Public Cloud users</strong>: You do not have access to the Edge Router. Contact
    <a href="https://support.apigee.com/">Apigee support</a> for assistance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the <strong>backend service</strong> is overloaded:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>All users</strong>: Restart the appropriate backend server and then monitor it to
    see if the problem is resolved.</li>

    <li><strong>All users</strong>: If the problem persists, check if you need to increase the
    capacity of the appropriate backend server(s) and/or fix any issue with the backend
    server(s).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="connection-errors"><a id="connectionerrors" name="connectionerrors"></a>Connection
  errors</h2>

<aside class="note">The steps in this section are for Edge Private Cloud users only.</aside>

  <p>A connection error happens when an Apigee Edge Message Processor attempts to connect to a backend
  server and one of these problems occurs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Message Processor is unable to connect within the preset connection timeout period. (Default: 3 seconds)</li>

    or

    <li>The backend server refuses the connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="steps-to-diagnose">Diagnosis</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Check the Message Processor log (<code>/opt/apigee/var/log/edge-message-processor/logs/system.log</code>)
      for any of the following errors:

      <ol>
        <li>
          An <strong>onConnectTimeout</strong> error indicates that the Message Processor was unable to
          connect to the backend server within the preset connection timeout period.

      <ol>
        <li>If the backend server resolves to a single IP address, then use the following command:
          <pre class="devsite-terminal">telnet <var>BackendServer-IPaddress</var> 443
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>If the backend server resolves to multiple IP addresses, then use the hostname of
          the backend server in the <code>telnet</code> command as shown below:
          <pre class="devsite-terminal">telnet <var>BackendServer-HostName</var> 443
</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>If you are able to connect to the backend server, then you might see a message like <code>Connected
      to <var>backend-server</var></code>. If you are unable to connect to the backend server, this might be
    because the Message Processors' IP addresses are not whitelisted on the specific backend
    server.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

  <p>Whitelist the Message Processors' IP addresses on the specific backend server to allow
  traffic from the Edge Message Processors to your backend server. For example, On Linux, you could use
  <strong>iptables</strong> to whitelist or allow the traffic from the Message Processor's IP addresses
  on the backend server.</p>

  <p>If the problem persists, work with your Network administrator to determine and fix the
  issue. If you need any further assistance from Apigee, contact <a href=

  <h2 id="determiningthesourceoftheproblem"><a id="determinesourceofproblem" name=
  "determinesourceofproblem"></a>Determining the source of the problem</h2>

  <p>Certain types of errors can occur either on the incoming (northbound) or outgoing (southbound)
    connection. An incoming (northbound) error occurs between the client application and Edge. An
    outgoing (southbound) error occurs between Edge and the backend target server. To diagnose these
    kinds of problems, your first job is to figure out whether the error occurs on the northbound or
    southbound connection.</p>

  <h3 id="determiningthesourceoftheproblem-understandingnorthboundandsouthboundconnections">
  Understanding northbound and southbound connections</h3>

  <p>In Edge, you can encounter a 503 Service Unavailable error on either the incoming or outgoing connection:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incoming</strong> (or northbound) connection - The connection between the client
    application and the Edge Router. The Router is the component of Apigee Edge that handles
    incoming requests made to the system.
     </li>

    <li><strong>Outgoing</strong> (or southbound) connection - The connection between the Edge
    Message Processor and the backend server. The Message Processor is a component of Apigee Edge
    that proxies API requests to backend target servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you are an Edge Public Cloud user, you are probably unaware of internal components such as
  the Router or the Message Processor. These internal components are not visible or accessible to
  Public Cloud users. Where possible, we provide alternative ways to investigate the problem that
  do not require direct access to these components.</p>

  <p>The following figure illustrates northbound and southbound connections for Apigee
  Edge.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/IMG-3-4d.png"></p>

  <h3 id=
  "determine-whether-the-503-service-unavailable-error-occurred-at-northbound-or-southbound-connection">
  Determining where the 503 Service Unavailable error occurred</h3>

  <p>Use one of the following procedures to determine if the 503 Service Unavailable error occurred
  at the northbound or southbound connection.</p>

  <h4 id="procedure-1-using-ui-trace">Procedure 1: Using UI Trace (For all users)</h4>

  <p>This procedure can be performed by Public or Private Cloud users:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If the issue is still active, enable the UI trace for the affected API.</li>

    <li>If the UI trace for the failing API request shows that the 503 Service Unavailable error
    occurs during the target request flow or is sent by the backend server, then the issue is
    <strong>southbound</strong> (that is, between the Message Processor and the backend
    server).</li>

    <li>If you don't get the trace for the specific API call, then the issue is
    <strong>northbound</strong>, between the client application and the Router.</li>
  </ol>

 <h4 id="procedure-2-using-api-monitoring">Procedure 2: Using API Monitoring (For Apigee
Cloud users only)</h4>
  <p>If you are a Private Cloud user, skip this procedure.</p>

<p><a href="/api-monitoring">API Monitoring</a> enables you to isolate problem areas quickly to diagnose error, performance, and latency issues and their source,
  such as developer apps, API proxies, backend targets, or the API platform.</p>

<p><a href="/api-monitoring/sample-scenarios">Step through a sample scenario</a> that demonstrates how to troubleshoot 5xx issues with your APIs using API Monitoring.
For example, you may want to set up an alert to be notified when the number of <code>messaging.adaptors.http.flow.ServiceUnavailable</code> faults exceeds a particular threshold.</p>


  <h4 id="procedure-3-using-nginx-access-logs">Procedure 3: Using Nginx Access Logs (For Apigee
  Private Cloud users only)</h4>

  <p>If you are a Public Cloud user, skip this procedure.</p>

  <p>If the issue has happened in the past or if the issue is intermittent and you are unable to
  capture the trace, then perform the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Check the Nginx access logs (<code>/opt/apigee/var/log/edge-router/nginx/ <var>org</var>-<var>env</var>.<var>port</var>_access_log</code> ).</li>

    <li>Search if there are any 503 Errors for specific API proxy.</li>

    <li>If you can identify any 503 Errors for the specific API at the specific time, then the
    issue occurred at the <strong>southbound</strong> connection (between the Message Processor and
    the backend server).</li>

    <li>If not, then the issue occurred at the <strong>northbound</strong> connection (between
    the client application and the Router).</li>
  </ol>
