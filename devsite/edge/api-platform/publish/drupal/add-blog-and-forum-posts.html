  <p>The Developer Services portal lets you create blogs and threaded forums:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blog</strong> support lets users create, edit, and delete blog posts. In addition,
    role-based permissions let you restrict blog actions to specific user types.</li>

    <li><strong>Forums</strong> let users create threaded discussions with role-based moderation.
    You can add forums to the portal, group forums in a hierarchy, and configure user roles to
    control access to the forums.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="workingwithblogs">Working with blogs</h2>

  <p>The portal lets users with the necessary privileges create, edit, and delete blog posts. Blogs
  are made up of individual posts, which are time stamped and are viewed by date. Anyone, including
  anonymous users, can view the most recent blog entries by using the navigation link provided on
  the portal Home page.</p>

  <p>Any user with the necessary privilege can comment on a blog post. Comments can appear as soon
  as they are entered, or you can configure the developer portal so that comments must be moderated
  before appearing. By default, anonymous users cannot post comments.</p>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-aboutblogtypes">About blog types</h3>

  <p>The portal supports two blog types depending on your version of the portal:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The standard blog as implemented by the <a href=
    "https://drupal.org/documentation/modules/blog"><strong>Drupal Blog</strong></a> module is used
    by default by releases of the portal previous to version 14.02.156.1.</li>

    <li>The Apigee custom blog with a custom view of posts, support for the image, audio and video
    content types, and a "tumblr-style" editing toolbar as implemented by custom Apigee Drupal
    modules. Version 14.02.156.1 and later of the portal use the Apigee custom blog by default.
    Existing portals can be upgraded to use the new blog as part of upgrading to version
    14.02.156.1.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Many of the steps that you use to configure the blog are the
  same for both versions.</aside>

  <p>The custom blog is defined by three custom Drupal modules supplied by Apigee. The following
  table describes these modules:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Module</th>

        <th>Definition</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Devconnect Blog</td>

        <td>Defines the basic functionality of the blog.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Devconnct Content Creation Menu</td>

        <td>Defines the menu that lets you create different types of blog content.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>devconnect blog content types</td>

        <td>Defines the Drupal special content types for the blog: image, audio, and video. Without
        this module, you can only create blog entries of type article.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Determining your portal version and types of blog supported:</strong></p>

  <p>You can discover the portal version by using the following cURL command:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl &lt;portal url&gt;/buildInfo
</pre>

  <p>If you want to use the custom blog, ensure that your version is 14.02.156.1 or later.</p>

        <li><strong>Devconnct</strong> <strong>Content Creation Menu</strong></li>

        <li><strong>devconnect blog content types</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Save the configuration.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-viewingablog"><a name="view_blog" id="view_blog"></a>Viewing a blog</h3>

  <p>The developer portal displays recent blog posts on the Blog page. The blog entries are
  displayed in descending order by creation time. To display the Blog page, select Blog in the
  developer portal main menu.</p>

  <p>In addition, the developer portal is initially set up to display recent blog posts on the Home
  page. The entries are also displayed in descending order by creation time.</p>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-settingpermissionsfortheblog">Setting permissions for the blog</h3>

  <p>As an administrator, you control the permissions required to perform actions on the blog, such
  as creating, editing, and deleting blog posts.</p>

  <p>You also configure the permissions required to post, edit, and delete blog comments and
  whether a user's comment has to be moderated. If a comment does not have to be moderated, it
  appears immediately. If the comment has to be moderated, a portal user with the necessary
  permission to moderate comments must approve it.</p>

  <p><strong>To set blog permissions:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>People</strong> in the Drupal menu.</li>

    <li>Select the <strong>Permissions</strong> link at the top of the People page.</li>

    <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Comment</strong> area of the page.</li>

    <li>Under the <strong>Comment</strong> area, set the following permissions that control which
    users can add, view, edit, and approve comments:

      <ul>
        <li>Administer comments and comment settings</li>

        <li>View comments</li>

        <li>Post comments</li>

        <li>Skip comment approval</li>

        <li>Edit own comments</li>

    <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Node</strong> area of the page.</li>

    <li>Under the <strong>Node</strong> area, set five different permissions that control which
    users can add, edit, and delete blog posts:

      <ul>
        <li>Blog entry: Create new content</li>

        <li>Blog entry: Edit own content</li>

        <li>Blog entry: Edit any content</li>

        <li>Blog entry: Delete own content</li>

        <li>Blog entry: Delete any content</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Save your configuration.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-addingablogentry"><a name="add_blog" id="add_blog"></a>Adding a blog
  entry</h3>

  <p>All users with the necessary permissions can create a blog entry. However, you can configure
  user roles such that a user can add and edit their own blog entry, but not delete it. Or they can
  add, edit, and delete their own blog entry, but not edit blog entries from other users.</p>

  <p>If your version of the portal uses the Drupal Blog module, the following button appears to let
  you create a blog entry:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/createBlog_v24.png" width="135"></p>

  <p>The default blog editing page appears:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/createDefaultBlog_v24.png" width="428"></p>

  <p>If you are using the Apigee custom blog, and have enabled support for all blog content types,
  the following menu appears to let you create blog entries of different types:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/createBlog_v25.png" width="334"></p>

  <p>Select the button for the appropriate content type to create the new blog entry. Depending on
  the content type selected, the following editor appears:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/createVideoBlog_v25.png" width="416"></p>

  <p>The buttons on the lower right let you add content defined by the <a href=
  "https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">Bootstrap</a> project, including a carousel,
  featurette, jumbotron, and trifold.</p>

  <p>The lower area lets you add the associated media. For example, in the figure above for the
  video content type, you can add a video to the blog entry.</p>

  <p><strong>To add a blog entry:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Blog</strong> in the developer portal navigation menu.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Create new blog entry</strong> (Drupal Blog module) or the content type
    (Apigee custom blog).</li>

    <li>Add content in the <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Body</strong> sections.</li>

    <li>If applicable, click <strong>Edit summary</strong> to add a summary.</li>

    <li>Enter a comma-separated list of keywords. These key words are used to populate the Hot
    Topics view on the Blog page. You can optionally add the Hot Topics view to the Home page, or
    to any other page.<br>
    Depending on the type of Blog entry, you might have to expand the <strong>Meta tags</strong>
    area of the page to enter keywords.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.<br>
    The blog is published to the blog's front page and is listed on the Home page in the Recent
    Blog Posts area.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When you create a new blog entry, the Blog module records basic information about the content,
  including the author ID, date of creation, and content type.</p>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-moderatingblogcomments">Moderating blog comments</h3>

  <p>Users of the developer portal can post comments to blog entries. By default, a user has to be
  logged in to the portal to post a comment. A users ability to view, post, edit, and approve
  comments depends on their role and permissions as described above.</p>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-configuringthedisplayoftheblogpage">Configuring the display of the Blog
  page</h3>

  <p>The developer portal uses a Drupal view, called the <strong>Items tagged as blog content
  view</strong>, to control the display of blog entries on the Blog page. By default, blog entries
  are listed in descending order of creation date.</p>

  <p><strong>To configure the blog view</strong>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Structure &gt; Views</strong> in the Drupal administration menu.</li>

    <li>Select the <strong>Edit</strong> link in the row for the <strong>Items tagged as blog

    <li>Edit the view.</li>

    <li>Save your changes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="workingwithblogs-configuringthehottopicdisplayforblogentries">Configuring the Hot Topic
  display for blog entries</h3>

  <p>The developer portal uses a Drupal view, called <strong>Hot Topics</strong>, to control the
  Hot Topic display for blog entries on the Blog page. By default, Hot Topic items correspond to
  the keywords added to blog posts.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In releases of the portal previous to version 14.04.16, the Home
  page displayed the Hot Topics view by default. That view was replaced by the SmartDocs view in
  release 14.04.16. The Home page for the default Apigee theme only allows you to display three
  views. If you want to add the Hot Topics view back to the Home page, you must remove one of the
  existing views.</aside>

  <p><strong>To configure the Hot Topics view</strong>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Structure &gt; Views</strong> in the Drupal administration menu.</li>

    <li>Select the <strong>Edit</strong> link in the row for the <strong>Hot Topics
    (Content)</strong> view. This displays the page that you can use to configure the view.</li>

    <li>Edit the view.</li>

    <li>Save your changes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="workingwithforums">Working with forums</h2>

  <p>Forums let users with the necessary privileges create threaded discussions with functionality
  similar to other message board systems. A topic is contained within a forum, and each forum can
  hold many topics. Topics can also have their own URLs.</p>

  <p>Users post new topics to a forum. Each forum topic is comprised of an initial post, plus
  replies or comments. Depending on the user's privileges, the user can edit and delete their own
  posts, and edit and delete the posts of other users.</p>

  <p>By default, anonymous users can view posts but cannot post replies. Only authenticated users
  with the necessary privilege can reply to a post. Replies appear as soon as they are entered,
  meaning they are not moderated.</p>

  <p>Administrators set the permissions required to post, to edit exiting posts, and to delete
  posts. Administrators can also promote forum posts to the Forum Discussions area of the Home
  page.</p>

  <h3 id="workingwithforums-determiningthedrupalmoduleusedbytheforums">Determining the Drupal
  module used by the forums</h3>

  <p>The portal uses two Drupal modules to implement forums:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://drupal.org/documentation/modules/forum"><strong>Drupal
    Forum</strong></a> module is the core forum module and is used by default by releases of the
    portal previous to version 14.02.156.1.</li>

    <li>The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/advanced_forum"><strong>Drupal Advanced
    Forum</strong></a> module enhances the core Forum module to add additional features including
    improved styling, quick search for active topics, unanswered topics, new topics, and more.
    Version 14.02.156.1 and later of the portal use Drupal Advance Forum module by default.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Most of the steps that you use to configure the forums is the
  same for both the Forum and Advanced Forum modules.</aside>

  <p><strong>To determine which module is active:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Modules</strong> in the Drupal menu.</li>

    <li>Enter "forum" in the filter list at the top of the Modules page.

      <ul>
        <li>If the <strong>Advanced Forum</strong> module is listed and is enabled, then you are
        using the <strong>Advanced Forum</strong> module.</li>

        <li>If <strong>Advanced Forum</strong> module is missing or disabled, and the
        <strong>Forum</strong> module is enabled, then you are using the core
        <strong>Forum</strong> module. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Alternatively, you can discover the portal version by using the following cURL command:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl &lt;portal url&gt;/buildInfo
</pre>

  <h3 id="workingwithforums-configuringtheadvancedforummodule">Configuring the Advanced Forum

  <h3 id="workingwithforums-addingaforum">Adding a forum</h3>

  <p>By default, the developer portal comes with a single forum called General discussion. You can
  add additional forums, nest forums, and create forum containers which are groups of forums.</p>

  <p>A forum container gives you a way to create a collection of forums. However a container is not
  a forum itself, it simply defines a collection of forums.</p>
