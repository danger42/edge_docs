  <p>You can customize the appearance of the Developer Services portal to match your company theme,
  to add new content areas to the portal, or to change the layout of any page on the portal. Much
  of this configuration requires a working knowledge of <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.
  However, this page describes some of the basic tasks that you might want to perform to customize
  your portal.</p>

  <h2 id="customizingthesitetitleandslogan">Customizing the site title and slogan</h2>

  <p>You can set the title for the site, as well as its slogan. On the Home page, the title and
  slogan appear as:</p>

  <p>"Title | Slogan"</p>

  <p>The title is required, and is set to "New Apigee Site" by default. The slogan is not required,
  and is blank by default.</p>

  <p><strong>To set the title and slogan:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Configuration &gt; System &gt; Site Information</strong> in the Drupal
    administration menu.</li>

    <li>On the Site information page, set the <strong>Site Name</strong> and optionally the
    <strong>Slogan</strong>.</li>

    <li>Save the configuration.<br>
    Note that because of caching, changes to the tile and slogan may not appear right away. You can
    optionally flush the cache to make these changes appear. To flush the cache, select the Drupal
    icon in the far left of the Drupal administration menu, and then select Flush all caches.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="customizingthelayoutofthehomepage">Customizing the layout of the home page</h2>

  <p>The following figure shows the layout of the home page:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/portal-home-page_v24_1.png" width="500"></p>

  <p>Drupal provides an extensive mechanism for controlling the display of this page. This section
  describes the layout elements of the default main page and how to modify those elements. To
  perform a complete redesign of the page, see the Drupal documentation.</p>

  <p>The home page is divided into the following sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Main menu</strong>: Contains the Apigee logo and the Blog and Forum menu entries.
    The section below describes how to configure the main menu.</li>

    <li><strong>Welcome message</strong>: The string below the main menu that starts with the text
    "Welcome to the ...".  <a href=
    "/api-platform/publish/drupal/customizing-theme.html">Customizing the theme</a> describes how
    to configure the welcome message.</li>

    <li><strong>Top area</strong>: The area below the main menu that includes the welcome message,
    the two boxes with links to the documentation and building with an access key, and the large
    icon. This area is defined by a Drupal Block. Blocks are rectangular content areas on Drupal
    pages. To configure the top area, edit the Drupal Block that defines the content for that area
    as described below.</li>

    <li><strong>Bottom area</strong>: The area including the Recent Blog Posts, Forum Discussions,
    and Hot Topics areas. These three areas are implemented as Drupal Views. <a href=
    "/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-blog-and-forum-posts.html">Add blog and forum posts</a>
    describes how to edit these views.</li>

    <li><strong>Footer</strong>: Contains the Privacy Policy, Terms &amp; Use, and Contact links.
    See <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-and-edit-content.html#editingfooterpages">Editing
    footer pages</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="customizingthelayoutofthehomepage-customizingtheblockthatdefinesthetopareaofthehomepage">

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Structure &gt; Blocks</strong> in the Drupal administration menu.</li>

    <li>On the Blocks page, select the <strong>configure</strong> link for the Block named Homepage

  <h2 id="customizingthemainmenu">Customizing the main menu</h2>

  <p>The main menu appears at the top of each page of the developer portal. By default, it displays
  the Apigee logo and two menu entries: Blog and Forum. You can edit the main menu to change to
  logo and to set your own menu entries.</p>

  <p><strong>To change the logo:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>If your default theme is the Apigee Responsive theme:</strong>

      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha outside">
        <li>Select <strong>Appearance &gt; Settings.</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>If your default theme is the Apigee DevConnect theme:</strong>

      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha outside">
        <li>Select <strong>Appearance &gt; Settings</strong> <strong>&gt; Apigee DevConnect
        Theme.</strong></li>

    <li>Select <strong>Structure &gt; Menus &gt; Main</strong> <strong>menu</strong> in the Drupal
    administration menu.<br>

    <li>Add the required information and select <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong> on the Main menu page.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="renamingthemyappspagetomyapis">Renaming the My Apps page to My APIs</h2>

  <p>By default, every portal developer has a page named "My Apps" that they use to add, modify,
  and delete apps and the API keys associated with those apps. For example, developers can have
  multiple apps, can modify apps to add or remove API products, and view analytic information about
  app usage all from the "My Apps" page.</p>

  <p>However, some API providers want to simplify the display of information on the portal, and to
  simplify the interactions that developers have with the portal. For example, you can configure
  the portal to create a default app and API key when a developer registers on the portal. That app
  might even be the only app that the developer will ever access, and the site does not allow the
  user to modify the app. For information on creating a default app, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-and-manage-user-accounts.html">Add and manage user
  accounts</a>.</p>

  <p>Some site do not want to use the term "app" at all. These sites instead refer to APIs and API
  keys. In this situation, you configure the portal to replace the term "app" with "API", so that
  developers now have a page called "My APIs". However, the information displayed on the page is
  the same as for when the page was called "My Apps", as shown below:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/myAPIs_v_4.14.png" width="476"></p>

  <p>This change affects not only in the title of the My APIs page, but other areas as well. For
  example, in the figure above, notice that the button on the right now says "Add a new API" and
  the text below it refers to APIs instead of apps.</p>

  <p><strong>To configure the portal to display My APIs:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Configuration &gt; Dev Portal  &gt; Application
    Settings</strong> in the Drupal administration menu.</li>

    <li>Expand the <strong>Application UI Settings</strong> area of the page.</li>

    <li>Select the radio button corresonding to the text that you want to sue..</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Structure &gt; Menus &gt; Main menu</strong> in the Drupal
    administration menu.</li>

    <li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> link for the <strong>My Apps</strong> entry.</li>

    <li>Edit the <strong>Menu link title</strong> to say <strong>My APIs</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong> on the Main menu page.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="enablingthedrupaladminmenuformobiledevices">Enabling the Drupal admin menu for mobile
  devices</h2>

  <p>The default Drupal admin menu is not compatible with the small screen sizes of mobile devices.
  If you want to administrate your portal on a mobile device, then you can enable the new admin
  menu that supports mobile devices with a screen width of 767 pixels or larger.</p>

  <p><strong>To enable the mobile-compatible admin menu:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Modules</strong> in the Drupal administration menu. The list of all
    installed Drupal modules appears.</li>

    <li>Download and install the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/navbar" target=
    "_new">Navbar module</a>.</li>

    <li>If enabled, disable the <strong>Administration menu Toolbar
    style</strong> module.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong>.</li>

    <li>Disable the <strong>Administration menu</strong> module.</li>

    <li>Enable the <strong>Navbar</strong> module.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You will now see the mobile-compatible Drupal admin menu.<br>
