  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> This section describes how to enable SSO authentication using SAML in the Public Cloud.
    To enable SSO authentication using SAML in Edge for Private Cloud, refer to this <a href="https://community.apigee.com/articles/60901/sso-integration-via-saml-with-developer-portal-for.html" target="_blank">community article</a>. </aside>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">Security
  Assertion Markup Language (SAML) </a>specification defines formats and protocols that enable
  applications to exchange XML-formatted information for authentication and authorization.
  Administrators of organizations that have been configured for single sign-on (SSO) can configure
  the developer portal to use SAML authentication. </p>

  <p>The Developer Services portal acts as a client for Edge. That means the portal does not
  function as a stand-alone system. Instead, much of the information used by the portal is actually
  stored on Edge. When necessary, the portal makes a request to retrieve information from Edge or
  to send information to Edge.</p>

  <p>By default the connection between the portal and Edge uses Basic Auth. If you enable SAML
  authentication on Edge, then the portal must be updated to use SAML authentication to connect to
  Edge. With SAML enabled, access to the Edge UI and Edge management API still uses OAuth2 access
  tokens. However, now you can generate these tokens from SAML assertions returned by an identity
  provider.</p>

  <p>For complete details, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/configure-portal-with-saml">Configure the Developer Services portal for SAML</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> After you enable SAML on the portal, the portal connects to Edge
  by using SAML authentication. However, portal developers, meaning the developers building apps by
  using your APIs, continue to log in to the portal using Basic Auth as defined by the
  portal.</aside><!--<h2>Enabling SAML authentication</h2>
<p>Contact your Apigee customer support representative to enable SAML authentication on your developer portal.</p>
<h2>Editing the SAML authentication configuration</h2>
<p>Once enabled by Apigee, to edit the SAML authentication configuration:</p>
