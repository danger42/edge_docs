  <p><a href="https://bugherd.com/">BugHerd</a> lets Developer Services portal users submit
  comments and bug reports by making annotations directly on the portal. BugHerd converts these
  annotations to bug reports. You can then manage these bug reports to categorize them, assign them
  to developers, and track progress.</p>

  <p>BugHerd integration can be used internally by the team creating the portal to collect, track,
  and resolve issues. Less frequently, you can enable external users of the portal to create
  BugHerd annotations. You might do that for users for a specific user role, but not for all portal
  users. </p>

  <p>To add support for BugHerd to the portal:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a BugHerd account at <a href="https://mbsy.co/MdtC">http://mbsy.co/MdtC</a> to
    obtain a BugHerd project key.</li>

    <li>Enable the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/bugherd">Drupal BugHerd</a> module on the
    developer portal. The BugHerd module ships with the developer portal, but it is disabled by
    default.</li>

    <li>Configured the BugHerd module by specifying the project key that you obtained from
    BugHerd.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Drupal BugHerd module lets you control which user role has the necessary permission to
  create a BugHerd annotation, and lets you enable or disable annotations on portal administration
  pages. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Register for a free BugHerd account at <a href=

  <h2 id="afteryouenablebugherd">After you enable BugHerd</h2>

  <p>After you enable BugHerd and download the BugHerd browser extension, the BugHerd sidebar
  appears in the browser whenever you view a page on the portal.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/BugherdSidebar_v24.png"></p>

  <p>Use the sidebar to add and manage issues, or log in to BugHerd and manage your project from
  there.   </p>

  <h2 id="toaddadditionalusers">To add additional users</h2>

  <p>To add additional users, log in to your project on BugHerd, <a href=
  "https://www.bugherd.com">http://www.bugherd.com</a>, and select Team from the BugHerd menu. Use
  that menu entry to invite new users. The user receives an email from BugHerd with additional
  instructions.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> The invited users must have a role on the developer portal that lets them add
    annotations.

    <p>Also ensure that all users install the BugHerd plugin for their browser.</p>
