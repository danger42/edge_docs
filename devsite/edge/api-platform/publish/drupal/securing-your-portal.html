  <p>The developer portal is essentially a content management system (CMS) based on the open source
  Drupal (<a href="https://www.drupal.org">http://www.drupal.org</a>) project. Drupal provides a
  core set of features in the form of modules that make it easy for you to build the content for,
  as well as manage, websites.</p>

  <p>Drupal also has many security features that you should be familiar with as you build your
  portal. This page does not attempt to explain all of the Drupal security features, but instead
  contains links to documentation on some of the most commonly used Drupal security
  features. </p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> Regardless of the security features that you want to implement, make sure that you
    have:

    <ul>
      <li>Registered for Drupal security advisories and announcements from this page: <a href=
      "https://www.drupal.org/security">https://www.drupal.org/security</a>. </li>

      <li>Registered for Apigee updates and security advisories from: <a href=
      "https://status.apigee.com/">http://status.apigee.com/</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <p>Along with the security information described in the table below, you should also be familiar
  with Drupal's best practices for coding standards and security as described on this page:
  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/best-practices">https://www.drupal.org/developing/best-practices</a>.</p>

          user. To prevent username enumeration, install the <a href=
