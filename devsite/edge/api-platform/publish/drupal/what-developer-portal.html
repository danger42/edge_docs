  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The Apigee New Edge experience provides a simplified portal
  content development solution using Markdown. For a comparison of features between the New Edge
  experience and the Classic Developer portal (Drupal-based), see <a href=
  "https://docs-new.apigee.com/new-versus-classic-edge#portal-feature-comparison" target=
  "_new">Feature comparison of the portal development tools</a>.</aside>

  <p>Developer portals with social publishing features are increasingly being used for
  communication with the developer community. This includes communicating static content, such as
  API documentation and terms-of-use, as well as dynamic community-contributed content such as
  blogs and forums. </p>

  <p>As an API provider, you need a way to expose your APIs, educate developers about your APIs,
  sign up developers, and let developers register apps. Exposing your APIs to developers is only
  part of creating a truly dynamic community. You also need a way for your developer community to
  provide feedback, make support and feature requests, and submit their own content that can be
  accessed by other developers.</p>

  <p>Apigee Edge provides you with a Developer Services portal that you can use to build and launch
  your own customized website to provide all of these services to your development community. Every
  Edge customer can create their own developer portal, either in the cloud or on-prem.</p>

  <p>The following video introduces the Apigee Developer Services
  portal.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" src=
  "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MMbbGdffCUI" width="640"></iframe>

  <p>The following figure shows the home page of the default developer portal:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/portal-home-page_v24_2.png.png" width="527"></p>

  <p>The developer portal is essentially a content management system (CMS) based on the open source
  Drupal (<a href="https://www.drupal.org">http://www.drupal.org</a>) project. Drupal provides a
  core set of features in the form of modules that make it easy for you to build the content for,
  as well as manage, websites.</p>

  <p>Out of the box, the developer portal lets you create API documentation, supports blogging, and
  provides threaded forums. You can also customize the developer portal to meet your specific
  requirements. Customization lets you modify the portal appearance and also the way that
  developers interact with the portal.</p>

  <p>You use the Drupal menu to perform most customization. If you log in to the portal as a user
  with admin privileges, the Drupal menu appears at the top of every portal page:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/DrupalMenu_v24_2.png.png"></p>

  <p>Administration controls the process where developers request access to the portal, how
  developers register the apps that access your APIs, how you assign developers specific roles and
  permissions related to your APIs, and when to revoke developer access to APIs.</p>

  <p>You also use the developer portal to configure and control monetization. Monetization gives
  developers self-service access to Billing &amp; Reports, Catalog &amp; Plans, and
  monetization-specific settings through the developer portal.</p>

  <h2 id="typesofportalusers">Types of portal users</h2>

  <p>The following image shows two types of portal users:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/devportalUsers_v14_07.png"></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developers</strong> make up the community of users that build apps by using your
    APIs. App developers use the portal to learn about your APIs through SmartDocs, to register an
    account on the portal, to register apps that use your APIs, to interact with the developer
    community, and to view statistical information about their app usage on a dashboard.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>API team</strong> is the API provider that creates portal content, makes their APIs
      available to app developers, provides API documentation, and provides a mechanism for
      developers to register apps and obtain API keys. The API team performs basic configuration of
      the developer portal to:

      <ul>
        <li>Configure automatic or manual requests for API keys</li>

        <li>Maintain API documentation, forums, and blogs and optionally revision all changes</li>

        <li>Add API call tracing in real time from within the portal using Apigee&#8217;s Console
        To-Go</li>

        <li>Handle user comments and forum moderation</li>

        <li>Enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to features on the portal.
        For example, an administrator can enable controls to allow a registered user to create
        forum posts or use test consoles</li>

        <li>Customize email notifications to both administrators and developers for user creation
        and approvals</li>

        <li>Customize web forms such as "contact us" pages</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Not shown in this figure is a third type of portal user - the <strong>API product
  manager</strong>. The API product manager is responsible for defining how the API team builds the
  portal, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defining how APIs are packaged into products</li>

    <li>Defining the rules for app approval</li>

    <li>If Monetization is enabled on the portal, defining the pricing and billing plans for API
    products. For more on Monetization, see <a href=
    "/api-platform/monetization/basics-monetization.html">Understand monetization</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="customizingthedeveloperportal">Customizing the developer portal</h2>

  <p>As an API provider, consider how to customize the developer portal to best fit your APIs and
  to provide the necessary information for your developer community to use your APIs. Some
  considerations for your custom portal include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Easy access to your APIs</li>

    <li>Documentation, such as how-to guides and reference documents</li>

    <li>Community-contributed content such as blogs and discussion forums</li>

    <li>Sample code</li>

    <li>An easy sign-up process where new developers, apps, and APIs can be approved quickly</li>

    <li>Managed rights and credentials</li>

    <li>Tiered access control</li>

    <li>A look and feel that matches your organization</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The portal comes predefined with a basic configuration. For example, out of the box the portal
  is configured to allow anyone to register as a developer, but an administrator must approve each
  registration before the developer can log in to the portal. After registration approval, the
  developer can then register an app to request an API key and use the portal to access API
  resources.</p>

  <p>The steps in the default registration process are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The developer registers through the developer portal. In response, the portal sends an
    email to administrators to approve the account.</li>

    <li>An administrator approves the account, and an email is sent to the developer letting them
    know that they can now log in.</li>

    <li>The developer registers an app and selects the API products used by the app. In response,
    the portal assigns a unique API key to the app.</li>

    <li>The developer passes the API key when making requests to your API.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This out of the box experience is highly customizable. For example, you can override the
  default registration and authorization scheme so that a new developer is automatically approved
  and logged in after registration. Or, you can require the developer to accept a set of terms and
  conditions before they can log in for the first time.</p>

  <p>You also have complete control over the content available on the developer portal. Out of the
  box, the developer portal presents sample content such as API documentation, blog posts, and
  forum discussions. You can provide your own content, and customize the appearance of each content
  type.</p>

  <p>For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/customize-appearance.html">Customize the appearance</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="administeringthedeveloperportal">Administering the developer portal</h2>

  <p>Developers use your developer portal to access and use your API. Administrators perform
  account management tasks, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Customizing the developer registration process, including registration fields, built in
    Captcha, and automatic or manual approval</li>

    <li>Adding or approving developers. By default, any developer can register through the
    developer portal but needs to be approved by an administrator through the Dev Portal user
    interface.  Administrators can also create developers directly on the portal. The portal
    then automatically emails the developer that an account has been created for them.</li>

    <li>Modifying a developer's account. For example, administrators can change the user's account
    status from active to blocked or change the developer&#8217;s profile information such as the
    company&#8217;s name.</li>

    <li>Removing a developer. Administrators can disable or delete a developer's account.</li>

    <li>Assigning roles and permissions: Administrators can assign a specific role to a developer
    account. A role is associated with various permissions, such as permission to create books or
    other content. You can also change the permissions associated with a role or make new
    roles.</li>
  </ul>

  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-and-manage-user-accounts.html">Add and manage user
  accounts</a>.</p><!--<h2>Adding an API Console To-Go</h2>
<p>Many portals incorporate an API Console To-Go, which is a GUI provided by Apigee that developers use to explore and test your API without having to write any code. The console presents a point-and-click interface that makes it easy for developers to submit requests to your API, and to view the request and response objects. It also displays documentation to make it easy for developers to learn how to use your APIs.</p>
<p>The following image shows the API Console To-Go:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/ConsoleSelctAPI_v24.png" style="width: 600px; height: 303px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Create and configure the Console To-Go separately from your developer portal. Once created, you can integrate the Console To-Go with your portal, or make it available as a standalone utility.</p>
