  <p>A <em>theme</em> is a collection of files that defines the look and feel of a site. The
  Developer Services portal is initially defined with a default theme, which you can customize.
  This allows you to select your preferences for the look and feel of your portal. More
  specifically, you can change the color of links, backgrounds, text, and other theme elements. You
  can also change the welcome message that appears on the front page of your developer portal.</p>

  <p>You can customize the theme through the developer portal UI, or by writing code in a custom
  theme file to override the default theme file.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> If you want to write custom theme code, do not modify the portal's default theme
    files. If you do modify a default theme file, then those changes will be overwritten the next
    time you upgrade your portal.

    <p>Instead, create a sub-theme of the theme that you want to modify as described below in the
    section <a href="#sub-theme">Customizing a theme by creating a sub-theme</a>.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>Depending on your version of the developer portal, you will have several themes to choose
  from:</p>

  <table width="650">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Theme            </th>

        <th>Description</th>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Apigee Responsive theme</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Based on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a>, the default theme for
          later releases of the portal. This theme supports devices with widths from 768 pixels to
          1400 pixels. All Bootstrap 3 features are available in this theme.</p>

          <p><strong>Note</strong>: To use the Apigee Responsive theme, ensure that the Bootstrap
          7.x-3.0 theme is enabled.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>

        </td>

        <td>
          <p>The default portal theme previous to the Apigee Responsive theme.</p>

          <p>Existing portals can be upgraded to the new Apigee Responsive theme but must first
          ensure that all blocks, templates, and other content is compatible with Bootstrap 3, and
          that the Bootstrap 7.x-3.0 theme is enabled.</p>
        </td>

      </tr>

  </table>

  <h2 id="settingthedefaulttheme">Setting the default theme</h2>

  <p>If your portal is still using the older Apigee DevConnect theme, you might see a warning
  in the form:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
"Apigee DevConnect theme" is out of date 
</pre>

  <p>You can use the following procedure to set the default theme for the portal. You should
  always test a new theme first on a non-production system before deploying the theme to
  production.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> If you have any custom code the Apigee Responsive theme might not work out of the
    box, or at least not look the way you intend it to. You might need to subtheme the Apigee
    Responsive theme to get the correct look and feel, as described below.

    <p>If you allow access to your portal from different mobile platforms, ensure that you test the
    portal on those platforms to validate that the theme appears correctly.</p>

  <h2 id="customizingtheapigeedevconnecttheme">Customizing the Apigee DevConnect theme</h2>

  <p>The Apigee DevConnect theme is the default portal theme for older releases of the portal, and
  can be upgraded to the new Apigee Responsive theme. However, you must first ensure that all
  blocks, templates, and other content is compatible with Bootstrap 3 before performing the
  upgrade.</p>

  <p><strong><strong>To customize the general settings of the Apigee DevConnect
  theme</strong>:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Appearance &gt; Apigee DevConnect theme &gt; Settings</strong> in the Drupal
    administration menu. This displays the initial settings for the theme. Color settings are
    specified as hexadecimal values.

      <p><img src="/api-baas/images/Themes.png" width="550"></p>
    </li>

    <li>Change the settings to suit your preference.<br>
    For example, add or change the welcome message or change the header background color. The
    header background color is initially set to something close to orange (#FF4300). You can change
    it to another color such as blue (#0000FF).</li>

    <li>When you are done changing the settings, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="sub-theme">Customizing a theme by creating a sub-theme</h2>

  <p>All of the files and assets that define the default themes shipped with the portal are in the
  <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">profiles/apigee/themes</span> directory
  under the portal installation directory. This directory is at <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/var/www/html/profiles/apigee/themes</span> if you
  installed the portal in the default location.</p>

  <p>To edit a theme to modify the look and feel of the site, do not modify the theme files under
  <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">profiles/apigee/themes</span> directly.
  If you do, your changes will be overwritten the next time you upgrade the portal.</p>

  <p>Instead, create a sub-theme of the theme that you want to modify by copying the default theme
  files to the <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">sites/all/themes</span>
  directory. This directory is at <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/var/www/html/sites/all/themes</span> if
  you installed the portal in the default location. For instructions on sub-themes, see the Drupal
  documentation at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/225125">https://www.drupal.org/node/225125</a>.</p>

  <div>
    The Drupal documentation specified above has detailed information about creating a sub-theme,
    but the general steps are listed below for creating a sub-theme of the Apigee Responsive theme:
  </div>

  <ol>
    <li>Copy the <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">profiles/apigee/themes/apigee_responsive/apigee_responsive_starterkit</span> folder
    to the <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">sites/all/themes</span>
    folder.</li>

    <li>Rename the <span style=
    "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">apigee_responsive_starterkit</span> folder
    to YOUR_THEME_NAME.</li>

    <li>Rename the <span style=
    "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">apigee_responsive_starterk</span><span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">it.info</span> file to YOUR_THEME_NAME.info.</li>

    <li>Rename the <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">css/apigee_responsive_starterkit.css</span> to
    css/YOUR_THEME_NAME.css.</li>

    <li>Rename the <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">js/apigee_responsive_starterkit.js</span> to
    YOUR_THEME_NAME.js.</li>

    <li>Edit YOUR_THEME_NAME.info file and replace the following lines:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">stylesheets[all][] =
    css/apigee_responsive_starterkit.css<br>
    scripts[] = js/apigee_responsive_starterkit.js</span><br>
    <br>
    with:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">stylesheets[all][] =
    css/YOUR_THEME_NAME.css<br>
    scripts[] = js/YOUR_THEME_NAME.js</span></li>

    <li>Change the name of the theme in YOUR_THEME_NAME.info file from <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Apigee Responsive Starter Kit</span> to YOUR THEME
    NAME.</li>

    <li>If you want to add a new screenshot for your theme then replace the existing <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">screenshot.png</span> file.</li>

    <li>If you want to add a new logo to your theme then replace the exiting <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">logo.png</span> file.</li>

    <li>If you want to add a new favicon to your theme replace the existing <span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">favicon.ico</span> file.</li>
  </ol>{% endblock %}
