  <h2 id="task1createanapiproductonedge">Task 1: Create an API product on Edge</h2>

  <p>The first task in publishing is to create an API product. An API product is a collection of
  API resources that are offered as a package to app developers for consumption. Create API
  products by using the Edge management API or UI. (See <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/what-api-product.html">What is an API product?</a> to learn more about API
  products.)</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/APIProduct_v14.png"></p>

  <p>In this figure, the API consists of two products, each containing three API resources.</p>

  <p>As an API provider, you are responsible for building the APIs and API products to handle
  access control, usage restrictions, and any other business requirements. For example, you
  might:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Release a free API product that allows read-only access to its API resources.</li>

    <li>Release a second API product for a low price that allows read/write access to the same API
    resources as the free version but with a low access limit, such as 1000 requests per day.</li>

    <li>Release a third API product for a higher price that allows read/write access the same
    API resource but with a high access limit.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The important thing to remember is that Edge give you the flexibility to create API products
  that match the business requirements of your APIs.</p>

  <p>For more information on creating API products, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/create-api-products.html">Create API products</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="task2registeranappdeveloperonedge">Task 2: Register an app developer on Edge</h2>

  <p>A developer creates the apps that consume your APIs. An app developer registers on Apigee Edge
  before they can register their app. When they register their app, they receive an API key that
  will give the app access to the API. </p>

  <p>Through the app registration process, you control who has access to your APIs. At any time,
  you can delete an app developer, which invalidates all API keys associated with that developer,
  therefore denying that developer access to your APIs.</p>

  <p><strong><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/devApp_v14.png"></strong></p>

  <p>As an API provider, you decide how to register developers. For example, you can use a manual
  registration process that requires a potential developer to contact your organization to
  register. The potential developer must supply all necessary information, such as an email
  address, first and last name, and company name. If you approve the developer&#8217;s request, you
  can use the Edge management UI to manually register the developer. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product.html">Managing app developers</a> for
  more.</p>

  <p>Apigee also provides tools that you can use to automate the developer registration process.
  For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use the Apigee Edge management API to integrate registration functionality into your
    existing website. The Edge management API is a REST API that you can use to perform all aspects
    of the developer registration process. See <a href=
    "/api-platform/publish/using-edge-management-api-publish-apis.html">Using the Edge management
    API to Publish APIs</a> for more.</li>

    <li>Use the Apigee Developer Services portal to register developers. The portal has built-in
    support for developer registration, but also has many other features to support your APIs. See
    <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/what-developer-portal.html">What is a developer
    portal?</a> for more.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="task3registeradeveloperapponedge">Task 3: Register a developer app on Edge</h2>

  <p>Before an app can access your APIs, the app must be registered on Edge. However, only a
  registered developer can register an app on Edge.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/registerApp_v14.png"></p>

  <p>At the time of app registration, the developer selects one or more API products. For example,
  you might publish multiple API products corresponding to different types of services and pricing
  plans. The app developer can then pick and choose from the list of available API products.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Edge does not require that you to let the developer associate
  multiple API products with an app. Your publishing plan can be structured such that the developer
  can select only a single API product. Or, you can automatically assign a default API product to
  all apps so that the developer does not even get to choose one.</aside>

  <p>In response to registering the app on Edge, Edge assigns a unique API key to the app. The app
  must pass that API key as part of every request to an API resource. The key is authenticated and,
  if valid, the request is granted. At any time, you as the service provider can revoke the key so
  that the app can no longer access your APIs.</p>

  <p>As an API provider, you decide how you want to register apps. You could:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use a manual  process that requires a developer to contact your organization to
    register their app. In response, you would send the developer the API key, possibly by
    email.</li>

    <li>Use the Edge management API to integrate app registration functionality and key delivery
    into your website.</li>

    <li>For a paid Edge account, use the Apigee Developer Services portal which has built in
    support for app registration and API key delivery.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> As a best practice, there is a 1-1 correlation between the app
  that the developer registers on Edge and the actual client app that they build. However, this
  correlation is not enforced by Edge. For example, a developer registers a single app on Edge,
  associated that app with an API product, and receives back an API key. The developer is free to
  use the API key from any client app.</aside>

  "/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api.html">Register apps and manage API
  keys</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="task4documentyourapis">Task 4: Document your APIs</h2>

  <p>An important consideration for publishing API products is providing documentation and a
  developer feedback mechanism. Developer portals with social publishing features are increasingly
  being used for communication with the development community. This includes communicating static
  content, such as API documentation and terms-of-use, as well as dynamic community-contributed
  content such as blogs and forums, as well as customer support features.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/docAPIs_v14.png"></p>

  <p>You can build your own website to deploy your documentation or, if you have a paid Edge
  account, you can use the <strong>Apigee Developer Services portal</strong>. The portal has
  built-in support for documentation, blogs, forums, and other types of content required to support
  your developer community.</p>
  <!--<p>You can use the <strong>Apigee</strong> <strong>Console</strong> to document your APIs, and incorporate the console into your portal. The console is an interactive GUI that lets developers make requests to your API without having to write any code. You can use the Console to set request, header, and body parameters, view the request and response content, and pass authentication credentials to the API.</p>--><!--<p><img alt="" src="/images/ConsoleSelctAPI_v24.png" style="width: 600px; height: 303px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 15px;"></p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-089b2aa8-f203-ed29-a341-76c05eba0afc" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">For more information, see <a href="/node/279.html">279</a>.</p>-->

  <p><strong>SmartDocs</strong> lets you document your APIs on the Developer Services portal in a
  way that makes the API documentation fully interactive. Interactive documentation with SmartDocs
  means portal users can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Read about the API</li>

    <li>Send a live request to the API</li>

    <li>View a live response returned from the API</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, the following figure shows an API documented on the portal by using SmartDocs.
  This API provides weather information for a specific location:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/smartD_example.png" width="300"></p>

  <p>The developer enters a value for the 'w' query parameter to specify the location, and then
  clicks the <strong>Send the request</strong> button to see the live request and response. By
  creating an interactive documentation on your APIs, you make it easy for portal user to learn,
  test, and evaluate your APIs.</p>

  <p>The Edge management API is a REST API that enables you to access API Services using any HTTP
  client. Apigee uses SmartDocs to create interactive documentation for the Edge management API.

  "_blank">here</a>.</p>
