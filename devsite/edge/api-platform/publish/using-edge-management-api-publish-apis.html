  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}Using the Edge management API to Publish APIs{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>This topic covers the definition of API products. API products enable developers to register
  apps that consume APIs using API keys and OAuth access tokens. API products are designed to
  enable you to 'bundle' API resources and then publish those bundles to different groups of
  developers. For example, you may need to publish one set of API resources to your partner
  developers, while you publish another bundle to external developers. API products enable you to
  perform this bundling on-the-fly, without requiring any changes to your APIs themselves. An
  additional benefit is that developer access can 'upgraded' and 'downgraded' without requiring
  developers to obtain new consumer keys for their apps.</p>

  <p><strong>Using the UI instead</strong><br>
  This topic demonstrates provisioning API products, apps, and developers using the Apigee Edge
  management API. You can also provision API products, developers, and apps using the Apigee Edge
  <a href="https://enterprise.apigee.com">management UI</a>. For instructions on using the Edge
  management UI, see <a href="/api-platform/publish/create-api-products.html">Create API
  products</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="configuringapiproducts">Configuring API products</h2>

  <p>You can configure API products using the Edge management UI or the Edge management API. The
  API enables you to create and manage API products programmatically.</p>

  <p>To set up a minimal API product using the Apigee Edge management API, POST a payload to the
  <code>/apiproducts</code> resource in your organization using the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/apiproducts">Create API Product</a> API.</p>

  <p>The following request creates an API product called <code>weather_free</code>. The API product
  provides access to all APIs exposed by the API proxy called <code>weatherapi</code> that is
  deployed in the <code>test</code> environment. The approval type is set to <code>auto</code>--any
  request for access will be approved.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> Remember to change the values for <code>email</code>,
  <code>password</code>, and <code>org_name</code> to match the settings for your account on

  <p>You have now set up a very basic API product that can be used to restrict access to the API
  proxy named <code>weatherapi</code> running in the environment called <code>test</code>.</p>

  <p>The API product created above implements the most basic scenario--it authorizes requests to an
  API proxy in an environment. It defines an API product that enables an authorized app to access
  any API resources accessed through the API proxy running in the test environment. API products
  expose additional configuration settings that enable you to customize access control to your APIs
  for different developer groups. For example you can create two API products that provide access
  to different API proxies. You can also create two API products that provide access to the same
  API proxies, but with different associated Quota settings.</p>

  <h2 id="apiproductconfigurationsettings">API product configuration settings</h2>

  <p>API products expose the following configuration options:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>

        <th>Description</th>

        <th>Default</th>

      <tr>
        <td><code>apiResources</code></td>

        <td>
          <p>A comma-separated list of URIs, or <em>resource paths</em>, 'bundled' into the API
          product.</p>

          <p>By default, the resource paths are mapped from the <code>proxy.pathsuffix</code>
          variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the
          ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, in the sample API product below, the
          <code>apiResources</code> element is defined to be <code>/forecastrss</code>. Since the
          Base Path defined for this API proxy is <code>/weather</code>, that means that only
          requests to <code>/weather/forecastrss</code> are permitted by this API product.</p>

          <p>You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with a wildcard.
          Wildcards (/** and /*) are supported. The double asterisk wildcard indicates that all
          sub-URIs are included. A single asterisk indicates that only URIs one level down are
          included.<br>
          <br>
          By default, <strong>'</strong>/' supports the same resources as '/**' as well as the Base
          Path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the Base Path of the API proxy is
          <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/v1/weatherapikey</span>, then
          the API product supports requests to <span style=
          "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/v1/weatherapikey</span> and to any
          sub-URIs, such as <span style=

          <span style=

  <h3 id="apiproductconfigurationsettings-anoteonscopes">A note on scopes</h3>

  <p>A scope is a concept drawn from OAuth and maps roughly to the concept of a 'permission'. On
  Apigee Edge, scopes are completely optional. You can use scopes to achieve finer-grained
  authorization. Every consumer key issued to an app is associated with a 'master scope'. The
  master scope is the set of all scopes in all API products for this the app has been approved. For
  apps approved to consume multiple API products, the master scope is the union of all scopes
  defined in the API products for which the consumer key has been approved.</p>

  <h2 id="registeringdevelopers">Registering developers</h2>

  <p>All apps belong to either developers or companies. Therefore, to create an app, you first need
  to register a developer or company.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> This section describes how to register apps for developers. You can use the
    Companies API to set up a company group and the Company Developers API to add developers to the
    company. See <a href="/api/companies-0">Companies</a> and <a href=
    "/api/company-developers-0">Company Developers</a> for more.

    <p>If you use the Developer Services portal, Apigee recommends that you create, edit, and
    delete developers on the portal itself, not using the Edge management API. For more
    information, see <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-and-manage-user-accounts.html">Add
    and manage user accounts</a>.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>Developers are registered in an organization by creating a profile. Note that the developer
  email that is included in the profile is used as the unique key for the developer throughout
  Apigee Edge.</p>

  <p>To support monetization, you must define the <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product.html#definingmonetizationattributes">monetization
  attributes</a> when creating or editing developers. You can also define other arbitrary
  attributes for use in custom analytics, custom policy enforcement, and so on; these arbitrary
  attributes will not be interpreted by Apigee Edge, </p>

  <p>For example, the following request registers a profile for a developer whose email address is
  <code>ntesla@theremin.com</code> and defines a subset of <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product.html#definingmonetizationattributes">monetization
  attributes</a> using the <a href=

  <h2 id="registeringdeveloperapps">Registering developer apps</h2>

  <p>Every app that is registered on Apigee Edge is associated with a developer and an API product.
  When an app is registered on behalf of a developer, Apigee Edge generates a "credential" (a
  consumer key and secret pair) that identifies the app. The app then must pass these credentials
  as part of every request to an API product associated with the app.</p>The following request uses
  the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email}/apps">Create
  Developer App</a> API to register an app for the developer you created above:
  ntesla@theremin.com. When registering an app you define a name for the app, a <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">callbackUrl</span>, and a list of one or more API
  products:
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d \

  <p>The <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">callbackUrl</span> is used by
  some OAuth grant types (such as authorization code) to validate redirect requests from the app.
  If you use OAuth, then this value must be set to the same value as the <code>redirect_uri</code>
  used to make OAuth requests.</p>

  <p>The <code>keyExpiresIn</code> attribute specifies, in milliseconds, for the lifetime of the
  consumer key that will be generated for the developer app. The default value, -1, indicates an

  <h3 id="managingconsumerkeysforapps-addinganapiproducttoanappandkey">Adding an API product to an
  app and key</h3>

  <p>To update an app to add a new API product, you actually add the API product to the app's key
  using the <strong>Add API Product to Key API</strong>. See <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email}/apps/{app_name}/keys/{consumer_key}">
  Add API Product to Key</a> for more.</p>

  <p>Adding an API product to an app key enables the app that holds the key to access the API
  resources bundled in the API product. The following method call adds a new API product to an
  app:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d \
'{
  "apiProducts": [ "newAPIProduct"]
}' \

</pre>

  <p>Sample Response:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
{
  "apiProducts": [
   {
     "apiproduct": "weather_free",
     "status": "approved"
   },
   {

  <p>Setting approval type to <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">manual</span> enables you to control which
  developers can access the resources protected by API products. When API products have key
  approval set to <code>manual</code>, consumer keys must be explicitly approved. Keys can be
  explicitly approved using the <strong>Approve or Revoke Specific Key of Developer App</strong>
  API:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:appilcation/octet-stream" \ 
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/developers/ntesla@theremin.com/apps/weatherapp/keys/HQg0nCZ54adKobpqEJaE8FefGkdKFc2J?"action=approve" \

  <p>The association of an API product with a consumer key also has a status. For API access to be
  successful, the consumer key must be approved, <i>and</i> the consumer key must be approved for
  the appropriate API product. The association of a consumer key with an API product can be
  approved by using the <strong>Approve or Revoke API Product for a Key for a Developer
  App</strong> API:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">

  <h3 id="managingconsumerkeysforapps-revokingapiproductsforconsumerkeys">Revoking API products for
  consumer keys</h3>

  <p>There are many reasons why you may need to revoke a consumer key's association with an API
  product. You may need to remove an API product from a consumer key due to non-payment by the
  developer, an expired trial period, or When an app is promoted from one API product to
  another.</p>

  <p>To revoke the association of a consumer key with an API product, use the <strong>Approve
  or Revoke Specific Key of Developer App </strong>API, using the action revoke against the
  consumer key of the develop app:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/octet-stream" \

  <h2 id="enforcingapiproductsettings">Enforcing API product settings</h2>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> API product settings are enforced by matching policies, such
  as VerifyAPIKey, OAuthV2, and Quota. Until those policies are attached to API proxies, API
  products and quotas will not be enforced by Apigee Edge.</aside>

  <p>For API products to be enforced, one of the following policy types must be attached to the API
  proxy flow:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>VerifyAPIKey: Takes a reference to an API key, verifies that it represents a valid app, and
    matches the API product. See <a href=
    "/api-platform/reference/policies/verify-api-key-policy.html">Verify API Key policy</a> for
    more.</li>

    <li>OAuthV1, &#8220;VerifyAccessToken&#8221; operation: Verifies the signature, validates an
    OAuth 1.0a access token and &#8220;consumer key&#8221;, and matches the app to the API product.
    See <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/oauth-10-policy.html">OAuth v1.0a policy</a> for
    more.</li>

    <li>OAuthV2, &#8220;VerifyAccessToken&#8221; operation: Verifies that the OAuth 2.0 access
    token is valid, matches the token to the app, verifies that the app is valid, and then matches
    the app to an API product. See <a href="/api-platform/security/oauth/oauth-home.html">OAuth
    home</a> for more.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once policies and API products are configured, the following process is executed by Apigee
  Edge:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A request is received by Apigee Edge and routed to the appropriate API proxy.</li>

    <li>A policy is executed that verifies the API key or OAuth access token presented by the
    client.</li>

    <li>Edge resolves the API Key or access token to an app profile.</li>

    <li>Edge resolves the list (if any) of API products associated with the app.</li>

    <li>The first API product that matches is used to populate Quota variables.</li>

    <li>If no API product matches the API key or access token, then the request is rejected.</li>

    <li>Edge enforces URI-based access control (environment, API proxy, and URI path) based on the
    API product settings, along with Quota settings.</li>
  </ol>
