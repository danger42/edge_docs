  <p>This topic explains how to register and manage apps by using the Apigee Edge management UI.
  The steps described in this topic require an Edge user with an org admin role or, otherwise, a
  role that grants sufficient permission to create and/or edit developer apps.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you have a Developer Services portal, developers can register
  their own apps. See <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/what-developer-portal.html">What is a
  developer portal?</a> for more.</aside>

  <h2 id="whatisadeveloperapp">What is a developer app?</h2>

  <p>Let's assume you are an API provider and you have created one or more API products to bundle
  your APIs, as explained in <a href="/api-platform/publish/create-api-products.html">Create API
  products</a>. Typically, developers who want to consume your APIs go to your developer portal and
  register to use them. When registering, the developer gets to select which of your API products
  they want to use. For example, some products may be offered for free, while others require
  payment depending on a service plan. Upon completion, this registration step produces an Edge
  entity called a <strong>developer app</strong>. A developer app includes the products the
  developer selected and a set of API keys that the developer will be required to use to access the
  APIs that are associated with those products. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/what-developer-portal.html">What is a developer portal?</a> for
  more on developer portals.</p>

  <p>However, a developer portal is not the only way to create developer apps. An Edge org admin,
  or another individual with the appropriate permissions, can also create developer apps directly
  in the Edge UI. As an API provider, you might want to maintain complete control over the app
  registration process and choose to register apps by using the Edge management UI. For example,
  you may want to register apps for your internal development teams or on behalf of a developer
  without access to your portal. Similar to registration through a portal, when you register an app
  in the Edge UI, you decide which API products to associate with it. When the app is registered,
  Edge automatically generates an API key to grant access to the selected API products. It is then
  up to you (the API provider) to determine how to pass that key to the app developer. Note that
  any additional API products you associate with the app all use the same key.</p>

  <p>Apps provide the main mechanism for API providers to control who can access their APIs. At any
  time, someone with appropriate Edge organization permissions can revoke an app's key, preventing
  it from accessing all API products referenced by that app. Or access to a single API product
  associated with the app can be revoked.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>As an org admin (or someone with appropriate role permissions), you can see all of your
  organization's apps in the Edge management UI on the <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps</strong>
  summary page. This page displays performance data for each app, and general information on app
  keys. You can select a specific app from the table to get more detailed information, including
  the API products that app can access and the resources those products expose. You can also see
  the key associated with the app.</p>

  <h2 id="registeringanappintheedgemanagementui">Registering an app in the Edge management UI</h2>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You must be an org admin or someone with sufficient role permissions to
  perform these tasks.</p>

  <p><strong>To register an app:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Login to the Edge management UI at <a href=
    "https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a>.</li>

    <li>Click the <strong>Publish</strong> tab, then <strong>Developer Apps</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>(+) Developer App</strong> on the Developer Apps page.</li>

    <li>Enter an application <strong>Name</strong>. This is the internal name you can later use in
    management API calls. You can't change the name after you create the app.</li>

    <li><strong>Display Name</strong> appears in the management UI, and it's the app name
    developers see in the developer portal. API administrators and developers can change the
    display name any time.</li>

    <li>Select a developer from the <strong>Developer</strong> list.<br>
      An app must be associated with a registered developer. If the developer does not appear in
      the list, you can register them. See <a href=
      "/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product.html">Managing app developers</a>
      for more.<br>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> For performance reasons, not all developers are displayed in
      the Developer drop-down list. Start typing the developer email in the search box to locate
      the developer you want.</aside>
    </li>

    <li>If necessary, enter the <strong>Callback URL</strong>.<br>
    A callback URL is the location of a resource that belongs to the app. For example, if you are
    using OAuth, this could be the location of a login screen where users enter their username and
    password. This value is not required for all API products.</li>

    <li>Optionally, add a descriptive note for the app.</li>

    <li>The <strong>Credentials</strong> section means "API keys." Set an expiration time or date
    for the API key that is automatically generated when the app is created. Then associate one or
    more API <strong>Products</strong> to the key. The developer will pass the API key in each call
    to API proxies contained in those API products. After the app is created, edit the app to add
    more credentials/keys with different expiration dates and products. For more information,
    see <a href="/api-platform/publish/create-api-products.html">Create API products</a>.</li>

    <li>Add any custom attributes for the app. You can add up to 18 of them. For each custom
    attribute:

      <ul>
        <li>Click <strong>(+) Add Custom Attribute</strong>.</li>

        <li>Add the attribute name and value.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.<br>
    Your app is added to the apps list on the Developer Apps page.</li>

    <li>If the product(s) you associated with the app require manual approval for their API keys:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Click the new app name.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the app.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>Approve</strong> next to the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

 <h2 id="editinganappintheedgemanagementui">Editing an app in the Edge management UI</h2>

  <p><strong>Note: </strong>You must be an org admin or someone with sufficient role
  permissions to perform these tasks.</p>

  <p><strong>To edit an app:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li>Modify the configuration.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Be careful when you edit custom attributes. You may have a system
    that has dependencies on custom attributes.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="managingapikeys"><a name="control_access" id="control_access"></a>Managing API keys</h2>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be an org admin or someone with sufficient role permissions to
  perform these tasks.</p>

  <p>API calls to API proxies usually require an <a href="/api-platform/security/api-keys.html">API
  key</a>. Edge lets the calls through only if the API key is active, valid, and meets the
  conditions defined by the API product containing the API.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> When you create an API product, you can also set its access mode
  to <strong>Internal only</strong> or <strong>Private</strong>. API products marked
  <strong>Internal only</strong> or <strong>Private</strong> do not appear to developers on the
  developer portal. To get access to these products, you manually add them to a developer's app
  from the Edge management UI.</aside>

  <h3 id="managingapikeys-approvinganapikey">Approving an API key</h3>

  <p>If an API product is configured for Automatic approval of API keys, you don't need to do
  anything. However, if a product requires manual approval of API keys, follow this procedure.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the app.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Approve</strong> for the corresponding product.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can also approve API keys using the <a href="/api/developer-app-keys" target=
  "_blank">management API</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="managingapikeys-revokinganapikey">Revoking an API key</h3>

  <p>You can revoke an API key, which means that particular key and secret are no longer valid for
  accessing APIs in the associated API product(s). You can re-enable access at any time by clicking
  Approve.</p>

  <p>(If you want to keep the key approved but prevent it from being used on a particular product,
  see the next section, "Revoking or removing an API product from an API key.")</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the app.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Revoke</strong> in the same row as the key and secret.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can also revoke API keys using the <a href="/api/developer-app-keys" target=
  "_blank">management API</a>.</p>



  <h3 id="managingapikeys-deletinganapikey">Deleting an API key</h3>

  <p>Deleting an API key removes the key and secret, which can no longer be used in API calls to
  APIs in the associated product(s).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the app.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Remove</strong> for the corresponding product.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can also delete API keys using the <a href="/api/developer-app-keys" target=
  "_blank">management API</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="managingapikeys-generatinganewkey">Generating a new key</h3>

  <p>You can generate a new API key/secret pair for a developer app. For instance, if you're using
  API key rotation, you can generate new keys whose expiration overlaps keys that will be out of
  rotation when they expire. You might also generate a new key/secret if the security of the
  original key/secret is compromised. If you generate a new key, any existing API keys will continue to work until they expire or you explicitly revoke them.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>+ Credential</strong> to generate a new API key with the desired expiration,
    then associate one or more API products with that key.</li>

    <li>In this screen you can also revoke or remove any other API keys with the
    <strong>Revoke</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons, which renders the keys unusable.
    Revoked keys can be re-approved and used later. Removed keys are deleted.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To generate a new API key with the management API, see <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}-0">
  Generate a new key pair for a developer app</a>.</p>

  <p>If you create custom keys (next procedure), this procedure does <em>not</em> regenerate those
  keys.</p>


  <h3 id="managingapikeys-importingexistingapikeyscreatingcustomkeys">Importing existing API keys,
  creating custom keys</h3>

  <p>If you have existing consumer keys and secrets you want to import into Edge, or you want to
  create custom API keys, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/import-existing-consumer-keys-and-secrets.html">Import existing consumer
  keys and secrets</a>.</p>


<h2 id="managingapiproducts">Managing API products</h2>

  <li><a href="#managingapikeys-revokingorremovinganapiproductfromanapikey">Revoke or remove an API product from a developer app</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="managingapikeys-addproduct">Adding an API product to a developer app</h3>
<p>To add an API product to a developer app:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li>To add an API product to a new API key, click <strong>+ Credential</strong> to generate a new API key, select the desired experation, and add the API product to that key.</li>

        <li>To add an API product to an existing API key, in the API key section, click <strong>+ Product</strong> and select an API product from the drop-down list.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="managingapikeys-revokingorremovinganapiproductfromanapikey">Revoking or removing an API
  product from a developer app</h3>

  <p>If you want to keep an API key active but not allow it to be used with one or more API
  products, you can revoke or remove the products associated with the API key. Revoking keeps a
  product associated with the API key but doesn't allow the key to be used with it, and removing
  completely disassociates the API product from the API key.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt;
    developer_app_name</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the app.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Revoke</strong> or <strong>Remove</strong> next to the desired
    product.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can re-approve a revoked product or re-add a removed product.</p>

  <p>You can also use the management API for this procedure. See <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}/keys/{consumer_key}/apiproducts/{apiproduct_name}">
  Approve or Revoke API Product for an API Key</a> and <a href=

  Remove API Product for a Specific Key</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="revokingadeveloperapp">Revoking a developer app</h2>

  <p><strong>Note: </strong>You must be an org admin or someone with sufficient role
  permissions to perform these tasks.</p>

  <p>When you revoke a developer app, any approved API keys can no longer be used in API calls to
  Edge. On the Developer App Details page, the key status label on the API keys is shown in
  strikethrough text (<strike>Approved</strike> or <strike>Revoked</strike>); and if you
  mouse over the label, the tooltip says the app is revoked. If you re-approve the app, the
  strikethrough text on API key status disappears, and approved API keys are valid again.</p>

  <p><strong>Revoke a developer app in the management UI</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt; [app] &gt; Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Revoke</strong> in the App Status field.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>It may take a few minutes for the change to be recognized by all message processors. Until
  then, it's possible that some calls using the API keys might continue to get through. </p>

  <p><strong>Revoke a developer app with the management API</strong></p>

  <p>See <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}">
  Approve or Revoke Developer App</a>.</p>

  <p>If the app is registered in other organizations, you must also revoke it in each of those
  organizations as well.</p>

  <p>You can re-approve a developer app by editing the app and clicking <strong>Approve</strong> in
  the App Status field. When you do, all approved API keys are available for use. Again, it may
  take a few minutes for the change to be recognized on all message processors.</p>

  <h2 id="deletinganappintheedgemanagementui">Deleting an app in the Edge management UI</h2>

  <p><strong>Note: </strong>You must be an org admin or someone with sufficient role

  <p>If you delete an app, all client keys associated with the apps become invalid. Using an
  invalid key on a request causes the request to fail.</p>

  <p> <strong>To delete an app:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer Apps</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Delete</strong> next to the app, then click <strong>Delete</strong>
