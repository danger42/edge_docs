  <aside class="warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> In order for an API product to work correctly, do the following:

    <ul>
      <li>Include the appropriate security policy in your API proxies, such as Verify API Key or
      OAuth v2.0. The API product uses API keys and/or OAuth access tokens to enforce API
      access. For more, see <a href="/api-platform/security/api-keys.html">API keys</a> and
      <a href="/api-platform/security/oauth/oauth-home.html">OAuth home</a>.</li>

      <li>Add API proxies and/or resources to your API product to restrict access. Otherwise, any
      app associated with the API product will be able to make calls to any API in your Edge
      organization.</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <h2 id="understandkeyconcepts">Understand key concepts</h2>

  <p>Review the following key concepts before you create your API products.</p>

  <h3 id="understandkeyconcepts-apikeys">API keys</h3>

  <p>When you register a developer's app in your organization, the app must be associated with at
  least one API product. As a result of pairing an app with one or more API products, Edge assigns
  the app a unique consumer key. When the app makes a request to an API resource in an API product,
  the request must include its unique API key.</p>

  <p>API key enforcement doesn't happen automatically. You must enforce API key checking in your
  API proxies with a policy, such as the Verify API Key policy. Without some type of key
  enforcement policy, anyone can make calls to your APIs. For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/verify-api-key-policy.html">Verify API Key policy</a>.</p>

  <p>Bottom line, Edge automatically generates keys, but you have to enforce key checking in your
  APIs.</p>

  <h3 id="understandkeyconcepts-automaticversusmanualapproval">Automatic versus manual
  approval</h3>

  <p>By default, all key requests to an API product from an app are automatically approved. You can
  instead choose to approve keys manually. If you set this option in the Edge management UI when
  creating the product, you will have to approve key requests that come in from any app that adds
  the API product. For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api.html">Register apps and manage API
  keys</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="understandkeyconcepts-quotas">Quotas</h3>

  <p>Quotas can protect your backend servers for high traffic, and differentiate your product line.
  For example, you might want to bundle resources with a high quota as a premium product and use
  the same bundle with a lower quota as a basic product. A quota can help protect your servers from
  being overwhelmed if a product is particularly popular.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> Setting quota limits on a product does not automatically enforce quota. It's
    simply a default limit that can be referenced in quota policies. Here are some advantages of
    setting a quota on the product for quota policies to reference:

    <ul>
      <li>Quota policies can use a uniform setting across all API proxies in the API product.</li>

      <li>You can make runtime changes to the quota setting on an API product, and quota policies
      that reference the value automatically have updated quota values.</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <p>For information on configuring quota, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/quota-policy.html">Quota policy</a>. For information on on
  using product quota settings in quota policies, see <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/questions/1488/how-do-the-quota-settings-on-an-api-product-intera.html">
  https://community.apigee.com/questions/1488/how-do-the-quota-settings-on-an-api-product-intera.html</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="understandkeyconcepts-scope">Scope</h3>

  <p>As an added level of security, you can define any OAuth scopes, as a comma-separated list,
  that must be present in access tokens sent through the product. When you're creating a product,
  you need to be aware of all the scopes your organization uses. The scopes you add to a product
  must match existing scopes or the product is not secure.</p>

  <p>For more information about using scopes with Edge OAuth policies, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/oauth/working-scopes.html">Working with OAuth2 scopes</a>.</p>

  <p>You can create an API product in the Apigee Edge management UI at <a href=
  "https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a> or with the management API.
  This procedure shows the management UI version. For the API version, (see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/using-edge-management-api-publish-apis.html">Using the Edge management API
  to Publish APIs</a>).</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/create-product-1.png"></p>

  <p>To create a new API product:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Login to the Edge management UI at <a href=
    "https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a>. (You can obtain a free
    account at <a href="https://login.apigee.com/sign_up" target=
    "_blank">https://login.apigee.com/sign_up</a>.)</li>

    <li>Click the <strong>Publish</strong> tab, then <strong>Products</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click the <strong>(+) Product</strong> button.</li>

    <li>On the Add Products page, enter a <strong>Name</strong>. This will be the internal name of
    the product. You cannot edit the name once the product is created. You cannot use special
    characters in the name. </li>

    <li>Enter a <strong>Display Name</strong>. The display name displays in the UI. The Display
    Name field is automatically populated using the contents of the Name field, but you can edit
    it. You can change the display name at any time by editing the product. You can use special
    characters in the display  name. </li>

    <li>Optionally, enter a <strong>Description</strong> for the API product. </li>

    <li>Add at least one API proxy to the product. Click <strong>+API Proxy</strong>.<br>
      This limits access to the API proxies listed. You'll configure resources later in this
      procedure.<br>

      <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> If you don't select an API proxy, any app associated
      with the product can make calls to any API in your entire organization.</aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Environment</strong>: Select the environments the product will allow access to. For
      example, select the <strong>test</strong> environment for internal-facing products or the
      <strong>prod</strong> environment for public-facing products.<br>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The environments you specify here restrict access to API
      proxies based on where they are deployed. For example, if API proxy A is deployed to both the
      test and prod environments, but the Product only has the test environment selected, then an
      API call for the corresponding Developer App only allows access to API proxy A deployed in
      the test environment.</aside>

      <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> If you select no environments, the product allows
      access to <em>all</em> environments.</aside>
    </li>

    <li>Specify an <strong>Access</strong> level.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public</strong> - When developers create or modify their developer apps in
        a Developer Services Portal, they can see and select public products.</li>

        <li><strong>Internal only</strong> or <strong>Private</strong> - There is no
        functional difference between these two options. When an API product is internal only or
        private, the product doesn't appear in the Developer Services Portal. To let a developer
        use the product, you must manually add the product to a developer app in the management UI
        or with the management API. Once you do this, the developer sees the product associated
        with her app in the Developer Services Portal.<br>
        <img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/product-environment-create.png"></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Select a <strong>Key Approval Type</strong> as <strong>Automatic</strong> or
    <strong>Manual</strong>.<br>
      If you select automatic key approval, all key requests that come in from any app that uses
      this API product are automatically approved. If you select manual key approval, you will have
      to approve key requests that come in from any app that uses this API product. To manually
      approve keys:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>UI: Publish &gt; Developer Apps &gt; developer_app &gt;</strong> click
        <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the app &gt; <strong>Approve</strong></li>

        <li><strong>API:</strong> Use the <a href="/api/developer-app-keys" target=
        "_blank">Developer App Keys API</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Entering a quota <strong>Quota</strong> limit does not automatically enforce
      restrictions on the number of calls that can be made through the product. For more
      information, see the <a href="#understandkeyconcepts-quotas">Quota</a> section above.</p>

      <p>Enter a quota limit that you want to reference from quota policies.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Optionally, if you are using OAuth with the API product, enter the <strong>Allowed OAuth
    Scopes</strong> that you want the product to allow (such as 'Read' or any other scopes that
    apps will send with their API calls). You can specify multiple scopes as a comma-separated
    list. <br>

    with OAuth2 scopes</a>.<br>
    <img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/product_key_quota_scope_v1407.png"></li>

    <li>In the <strong>Resources</strong> section, add an <strong>API Proxy</strong>,
    <strong>Revision</strong>, and <strong>Resource Path</strong> to the API product.<br>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> See also this Apigee Community article: <a href=
      "https://community.apigee.com/articles/38309/making-sense-of-api-product-configuration.html">Making
      sense of API Product configuration</a>. </aside>Adding <strong>Resource Paths</strong>
      lets you further restrict API access with relation to the API proxies included in the
      product. For example, let's say you add a "music" API proxy to the product with a base path
      of <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/music</span>. That means the
      product allows calls to <span style=
      "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/music</span>.<br>
      <br>
      However, you want the product to allow access to only the <span style=
      "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">venues</span> resource, which has a URI
      of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/music/venues</span>.
      By adding a <span style=
      "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/<code>venues</code></span> <strong>Resource
      Path</strong> to the product, the product allows calls to only that URI. For example, calls
      to <code><span style=
      "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/music</span>/<strong>venues</strong>?name=paramount</code>
      go through, but calls to <code><span style=
      "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/music</span>/<strong>artists</strong>?name=Jack%Johnson</code>
      get rejected.<br>
      <br>
      You can add <strong>Resource Paths</strong> either by selecting one from an existing API
      proxy <strong>API Proxy</strong>, <strong>Revision</strong>, and a <strong>Resource
      Path</strong> (then click <strong>Import Resource</strong>), or by clicking <strong>+Custom
      Resource</strong> and adding a free-form resource pattern.<br>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> You can select a specific path, or you can select the base
      path and all subpaths by specifying the resource path as '/'.<br>
      <br>
      The <strong>Resource Path</strong> also supports the wildcards /** and /*. The
      double asterisk wildcard indicates that all sub-URIs of the base path are supported (but
      not the base path). A single asterisk indicates that only URIs one level down from the base
      path are supported.<br>
      <br>
      See <a href="#resourcebehavior">Configuring the behavior of a Resource Path of '/', '/*', and
      '/**'</a> below for more.</aside>
    </li>

    <li>(Optional) You can also add up to 18 custom attributes to an API product. Custom attributes
    are key/value pairs that can be used in many ways, including helping control API proxy
    execution. For example, you could create a custom attribute called
    <code>deprecated</code> with a value of true or false. In your API proxy flow, you could
    check the value of the API product's <code>deprecated</code> attribute (for example, using the
    <code>verifyapikey.{policy_name}.apiproduct.deprecated</code> variable that is automatically
    available after you create the custom attribute). If its value is true (deprecated), you can
    throw an error with the Raise Fault policy.</li>

    <li>Save your product.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="editinganapiproduct">Editing an API product</h2>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> To improve performance, API product information, such as
  resource path definitions, are cached for a short period of time (approximately five minutes). As
  a result, edits that you make to an API product may not take effect immediately.</aside>

  <p>To edit an API product:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Login to the Edge management UI at <a href=
    "https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a>.</li>

    <li>Click the <strong>Publish</strong> tab, then <strong>Products</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click the name of the API product that you want to edit.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> on the API product page.</li>

    <li>Edit the fields, as required.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="resourcebehavior">Configuring the behavior of a Resource Path of '/', '/*', and
  '/**'</h2>

  <p>The following table describes the default behavior of an API product for
  different <strong>Resource Paths</strong>. In this example, the API proxy has a base path of
  <code>/v1/weatherapikey</code>. The API product resource path applies to the path suffix after
  the base path.</p>

  <p>By default, a <strong>Resource Path</strong> of <strong>'</strong>/' in an API product
  supports the base path and all sub-URIs. For example, if the <strong>Base Path</strong> of
  the API proxy is <code>/v1/weatherapikey</code>, then the API product supports requests to
  <code>/v1/weatherapikey</code> and to any sub-URIs, such as
  <code>/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss</code>, <code>/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA</code>, etc.</p>

  <p>You can change this default so that a <strong>Resource Path</strong> of '/' corresponds only
  to the <strong>Base Path</strong> of the API proxy, meaning the API product will not allow access
  to a URI that has anything after the '<strong>/</strong>'. If you make this change, then in the
  table above, only the first two rows under "Allowed for '/'" would contain "Y".</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> <strong>Monetization</strong>: If your products will be used in
  monetization, where product resource paths are used to define transaction recording policies, use
  '<strong>/**</strong>' explicitly. Monetization treats '<strong>/</strong>' as base-path-only and
  not '<strong>/**</strong>'. </aside>

  <p>To change the default, a system administrator must set the value of the <span style=

  <h2 id="deletingresources">Deleting resources </h2>

  <p>You can delete resources that you've added to an API product. You might want to do this if a
  resource is malfunctioning or requires more development. When deleted, that resource is no longer
  part of the API product. Any app that uses the API product can no longer access the deleted
  resource. Deleted resources are removed from the product but are not deleted from the system, so
  they can still be used by other products.</p>

  <h4>To delete a resource</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>In the <strong>API Resource Paths for Product</strong> section of the product details
    window, locate the resource you want to disable, then click <strong>Delete</strong> in the
    Actions column.
