  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}Import existing consumer keys and secrets{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>Apigee Edge automatically generates consumer keys and consumer secrets when you create
  developer apps and associate them with API products. (Those procedures are covered in <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api.html">Register apps and manage API
  keys</a>.) However, you may have existing consumer keys and secrets that you want to import into
  Apigee Edge from another system. Technically, this process isn't an import. It's recreating the
  existing keys in Edge one at a time.</p>

<aside class="caution">Be aware of the following size limits on API keys. By staying within these limits, you help
  avoid service disruptions.</aside>

<table>
  <tr>
        <td class="column1-class"><strong>Consumer key</strong> (API key) size</td>
        <td class="column2-class">{{ limit_consumer_key_size }}</td>
      </tr>
  <tr>
        <td class="column1-class"><strong>Consumer secret</strong> size</td>
        <td class="column2-class">{{ limit_consumer_secret_size }}</td>
      </tr>
</table>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Keys and secrets must use alphanumeric characters, and can
  contain hyphens. Special characters other than hyphens aren't supported.</aside>


  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Create the consumer keys and secrets</strong> in Edge with the management API,
      one at a time.<br>
      See <a href=
      "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}/keys/create">
      Create a consumer key and secret</a>. Here's the cURL:<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -H 'Content-type:application/json' -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{organization}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}/keys/create -X POST -d \
'{
  "consumerKey": "key",
  "consumerSecret": "secret"
  }'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Associate the consumer key/secret with one or more Edge API products</strong>. Doing
      this allows the imported consumer key (also called the API key) to be used in calls to API
      proxies where authorization is controlled by products.<br>
      See <a href=
      "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}/keys/{consumer_key}">Add
      API Product to Key</a>. Here's the cURL:
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -H 'Content-type:application/json' -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{organization}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}/keys/{consumer_key_name} -X POST -d \
'{
 "apiProducts": ["product_1", "product_2"]
}'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Optionally delete the initial consumer key/secret that Edge auto-generated. However, you
    can keep the auto-generated key. Both the imported key and the auto-generated key work in API
    calls, and both are displayed on the Developer App Details page in the management UI.<br>
    See <a href=
    "/management/apis/delete/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}/apps/{app_name}/keys/{consumer_key}">
    Delete Key for a Developer App</a>.</li>
