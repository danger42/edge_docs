  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The legacy API Console is a free hosted service that is separate
  from Apigee Edge with no service-level agreement (SLA) guarantee.</aside>

  <p>Apigee API <em>Consoles</em> make it easier for developers to learn and use an API. Featuring
  an easy-to-use interface, Apigee API Consoles provide a GUI for exploring an API's resources and
  executing its methods, as shown below.</p>

  <p>Your first step when using the console is to choose the API and method that you want to use.
  Select the service that contains the API from the Service dropdown to open the panel on the left
  showing the available APIs and method. If you move the mouse over the API name, a popup appears
  with a brief description of the API. Select the document icon next to the API name to open a page
  describing the API. </p>

  <p>After you select the API, the request method and the base URL of the API appear in the
  console. You can now select the Authentication method, if necessary, and set query, template, or
  header parameters passed as part of the request:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/ConsoleRequestURL_v24.png"></p>

  <p>In this example, there is no authentication required, but there is a required query parameter
  named topic. After setting the query parameter, select the Send button to send the request. You
  can see the request and response objects at the bottom of the screen.</p>

  <p>Apigee provides Consoles for a growing number of API providers. Check out Apigee's current
  list of API providers <a href="https://apigee.com/providers">here</a>, then take a look at an
  console such as <a href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Twitter</a> or the <a href="">Apigee
  Platform Console</a>. Choose an API, select a method from the drop-down menu, enter any
  authentication information and parameters, and then press <strong>Send</strong>. Your request and
  the response are then displayed below. Tracing API calls is just that easy.</p>
  <!--<p>Now you can give developers these same tools to explore and engage with your API. Create an Apigee<a href="https://apigee.com/togo"> Console To-Go</a> for your API, and make it easy for developers to discover and learn your API.</p>
<p>This document is intended for readers who want to create an Apigee Console To-Go for their own web API.</p>-->

  <h2 id="whatisapigeeconsoletogo"><a name="whatistogo" id="whatistogo"></a>What is Apigee Console
  To-Go?</h2>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> <strong>Apigee Console To-Go has been retired.</strong> Your
  existing API Consoles will continue to work. You cannot create new or modify existing
  consoles.</aside>

  <p>Apigee Console To-Go is your own Apigee API Console&#8212;on your own site. Just describe your
  API using the Web Application Description Language (WADL), upload your description to Apigee to
  create a custom Console, customize the look and feel, and then embed your API Console on your own
  Developer Services portal.</p>

  <p>Your Console can display all methods available to developers, organized into groupings of your
  choice. Developers can browse the methods, reading the descriptions you provide for each method
  and parameter, and see what information is required for each request, what authentication
  mechanisms are supported, and what parameters are optional or required. More importantly,
  developers can use the Console to enter authentication credentials and easily test requests and
  see what responses are returned.</p><!--<div class="video">
