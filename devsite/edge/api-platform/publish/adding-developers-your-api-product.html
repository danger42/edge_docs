  <p>Edge provides many benefits that are completely dependent on knowing who's calling your APIs.
  For example, API security, traffic management, and a fair amount of analytics data depend on
  knowing who's calling. And how does Edge know who's calling your APIs? By reading unique
  information in each API call, such as a user ID, an API key, or an OAuth token. That unique
  information locks or unlock the functionality you build into your API proxies, giving you full
  control over API access and behavior.</p>

  <p>That's why app developers need to register to use your APIs. Once added, developers register
  their apps, choose the APIs they want to use, and receive the unique API credentials (consumer
  keys and secrets) needed to access your APIs.</p>

  <p>This topic covers how to register and manage your app developers. (App registration is a
  separate process covered in <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api.html">Register apps and manage API
  keys</a>).</p>

  <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> API security, traffic management, and developer/app
  analytics are dependent on proper API proxy configuration. For example, you need to add the right
  policies to your proxies, such as API key validation or OAuth access token verification, quota
  enforcement, and rate limiting. Those policies identify which specific developer and app is
  making the call, which in turn enables API security enforcement, developer- or app-specific
  traffic management, API analytics capture, and other functionality. Technically, you could
  develop open APIs that don't check for API keys or access tokens, which means you wouldn't really
  need to register developers. But we strongly discourage this, because you lose API security, lose
  control over performance (through good traffic management), lose out on analytics data, and miss
  out on other major benefits that Edge provides.</aside>

  <p>You can register developers in a number of ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have a paid Edge account, develpers can self-register through a Developer Services
    portal. See <a href="/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-and-manage-user-accounts.html">Add and
    manage user accounts</a>.</li>

    <li>By accessing a form that uses the Edge management API to register the developer. See
    <a href="/api-platform/publish/using-edge-management-api-publish-apis.html">Using the Edge
    management API to Publish APIs</a> for more.</li>

    <li>As an API provider, your administrative users can add developers in the Edge management UI,
    described below.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the Edge management UI, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developers</strong> to open the
  Developers page. You can see the apps they've created and the keys assigned to the developer.
  From this page, you can also manage the developer's information or delete them from your org.</p>

  <p>You can access the Drupal-based Developer Services portal from this page by clicking
  <strong>Dev Portal</strong>. If you have not created a developer services portal and wish to,
  click <strong>Submit a request</strong> in the dialog box to be redirected to a page that
  describes how to set up a developer portal.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you use the Drupal-based Developer Services portal, Apigee
  recommends that you log into the portal as a portal administrator to manually create, edit, and
  delete developers on the portal, not in the Edge UI. When you add a developer through the
  administrator interface on the portal, you can set the developer's password for the portal and
  trigger an automated email message sent to the developer. Also, any changes made to the
  developer's account on the portal are automatically sent to Edge. When adding or modifying a
  developer through Edge, no email is sent to the developer and you cannot set the password for the
  developer on the portal. Therefore, the developer must reset their password on the portal before
  they can log into the portal. For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/add-and-manage-user-accounts.html">Add and manage user
  accounts</a>.</aside>

      <ul>
        <li>Click <strong>(+) Add Custom Attribute</strong>.</li>

  <h2 id="deactivatingadeveloper">Deactivating a developer</h2>

  <p>When you deactivate a developer, none of that developer's API keys can be used to make API
  calls to Edge. The developer can still log into the developer portal and create apps, but none of
  the corresponding keys will work. The developer's apps still retain their approved (or other)
  status, as do the API keys, even though they're not valid while the developer is inactive.</p>

  <p>When a developer is inactive, and you view the Developer App Details page for each of the
  developer's apps in the management UI, the status label on the app and API keys appears in
  strikethrough text (<strike>Approved</strike> or <strike>Revoked</strike>); and if you mouse over
  the label, the tooltip says the developer is inactive. If you reactivate a developer, the
  strikethrough disappears, and approved apps and API keys are valid again.</p>

  <p>If the developer is in multiple organizations, perform these steps in each organization.</p>

  <p><strong>Deactivate a developer in the management UI</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Publish &gt; Developers &gt; [developer] &gt; Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Deactivate</strong> in the Status field.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>After deactivation, it may take a few minutes for the change to be updated on all message
  processors. Until then, some calls by the developer's app may continue to make it through
  successfully.</p>

  <p><strong>Deactivate a developer with the management API</strong></p>

  <p>See <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/developers/{developer_email_or_id}">Set Developer
  Status</a> to set the developer's status to <code>inactive</code>.</p>

  <p>You can re-activate a developer by editing the developer in the management UI and clicking
  <strong>Activate</strong>, or by using the management API and setting the developer's status to
  <code>active</code>. Again, it may take a few minutes for the change to be recognized by all
  message processors.</p>

  <p>If you are using a Developer Services portal to publish your APIs, changes made to developers

  <h2 id="groupingdevelopersintocompanies">Grouping developers into companies</h2>

  <p>With monetization, a company is a collection of developers managed as a single entity. A
  company can be any grouping that is appropriate to your organization such as business unit,
  product line, or division. Grouping developers into companies is useful when your need to
  have multiple developers associated under a single corporate entity. For example, you may
  need to set up different companies for billing purposes. However, developers in your organization
  don't need to be associated with a company. Note that a developer is always a single entity,
  uniquely identified by the email element. If a developer is part of a company you'll see the
  Company name on the Developers page. </p>
