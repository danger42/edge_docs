{% block body %}

  <p>Apigee Edge is a platform for developing and managing API proxies. Think of a proxy as an
  abstraction layer that "fronts" for your backend service APIs and provides value-added features
  like security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics, and more. The primary consumers of Edge API
  proxies are app developers who want to use your backend services.<p>

  <p>For example, you can <a href=

  view a webcast about how Walgreens uses APIs and Apigee Edge</a> to provide a rich app ecosystem
  around photo printing, prescriptions, and other services that they provide.</p>

  <h2 id="make-avail-web">Making your services available on the web</h2>

  <p>Companies today want to make their backend services available on the web so that these
  services can be consumed by apps running on mobile devices and desktops. A company might want to
  expose services that provide product pricing and availability information, sales and ordering
  services, order tracking services, and any other services required by client apps.</p>

  <p>Companies often expose services as a set of HTTP endpoints. Client app developers then make
  HTTP  requests to these endpoints. Depending on the endpoint, the service might then return
  data, formatted as XML or JSON, back to the client app.</p>

  <p>The client apps that consume these services can be implemented as standalone apps for a mobile
  device or tablet, as HTML5 apps running in a browser, or as any other type of app that can make a
  request to an HTTP endpoint and consume any response data. These apps might be developed and
  released by the same company that exposed the services, or by third-party app developers who make
  use of publicly available services.</p>

  <p>The following image shows this type of model:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/noEdge.png" width="40%"></p>

  <p>Because providers make their services available over the web, they must ensure that they have
  taken all necessary steps to secure and protect their services from unauthorized access. As a
  service provider, consider:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> How will you control access to your services to prevent
      unauthorized access?</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Will your services work across different platforms and
      devices?</li>
    <li><strong>Measurability:</strong> How can you monitor your services to make sure they are
      available?</li>
    <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> How can you track and bill customers for access to your
      services?</li>
    <li>And many other considerations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After a client app has been released that accesses any services, the service provider is then
  required to make sure that those services continue to work over time as they add, modify, or
  delete those services. The service provider must also have a way to keep app developers aware of
  any changes to the services to ensure that client apps stay in sync with those services.</p>

  <p>Client app developers face challenges when trying to consume services from different
  providers. There are many technologies available today for use by a service provider to expose
  its services. The same client app might have to use one mechanism to consume a service from one
  provider, and a different mechanism to consume a service from a different provider. App
  developers can even face the situation where they have to use different mechanisms to consume
  services from the same provider.</p>

  <h2 id="make-avail-edge">Make services available through Apigee Edge</h2>

  <p>Apigee Edge, which is built on Java, enables you to provide secure access to your services
  with a well-defined API that is consistent across all of your services, regardless of service
  implementation. A consistent API:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Makes it easy for app developers to consume your services.</li>
    <li>Enables you to change the backend service implementation without affecting the public
      API.</li>
    <li>Enables you to take advantage of the analytics, monetization, developer portal, and other
      features built into Edge. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following image shows an architecture with Edge handling the requests from client apps to
  your backend services:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/withEdge.png" width="40%"></p>

  <p>Rather than having app developers consume your services directly, they access an API proxy
  created on Edge. The API proxy functions as a mapping of a publicly available HTTP endpoint to
  your backend service.  By creating an API proxy you let Edge handle the security and
  authorization tasks required to protect your services, as well as to analyze, monitor, and
  monetize those services.</p>

  <p>Because app developers make HTTP requests to an API proxy, rather than directly to your
  services, developers do not need to know anything about the implementation of your
  services.  All the developer needs to know is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The URL of the API proxy endpoint.</li>
    <li>Any query parameters, headers, or body parameters passed in a request.</li>
    <li>Any required authentication and authorization credentials.</li>
    <li>The format of the response, including the response data format, such as XML or JSON.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The API proxy isolates the app developer from your backend service. Therefore you are free to
  change the service implementation as long as the public API remains consistent. For example, you
  can change a database implementation, move your services to a new host, or make any other changes
  to the service implementation. By maintaining a consistent frontend API, existing client apps
  will continue to work regardless of changes on the backend.</p>

  <p>You can use policies on the API proxy to add functionality to a service without having to make
  any changes to the backend service. For example, you can add policies to your proxy to perform
  data transformations and filtering, add security, execute conditional logic or custom code, and
  to perform many other actions. The important thing to remember is you implement policies on Edge,
  not on your backend server.</p>

  <p>For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies">Understanding APIs and API
  proxies</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="create-product">Create an API product</h2>

  <p>An API proxy is the HTTP endpoint on Apigee Edge that developers use to access your backend
  services. While it is possible, you typically do not make individual API proxies available.
  Instead, you group one or more API proxies into an API product.</p>

  <p>An API product is a bundle of API proxies combined with a service plan. That service plan can
  set access limits on API proxies, provide security, allow monitoring and analytics, and provide
  additional features. API products are also the central mechanism that Edge uses for authorization
  and access control to your APIs.</p>

  <p>You have a great deal of flexibility when creating API products. For example, multiple API
  products can share the same API proxy. The following figure shows three API products. Notice that
  all products allow access to API proxy 3, but only product A allows access to API proxy 1.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/products.png" width="40%"></p>

  <p>You can set different properties on each API product. For example, you might make available
  one API product with a low access limit, such as 1000 requests per day, for a bargain price. You
  then release another API product that provides access to the same API proxy, but with a much
  higher access limit, for a higher price. Or, you might create a free API product that allows
  read-only access to your services, and then sell an API product to the same API proxies that
  allows read/write access.</p>

  <p>For more information, see <a href="/api-platform/publish/create-api-products">Create API
  products</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="allow-client">Allow a client-side app to access your API product</h3>

  <p>When app developers decide that they want to access your services, they must first register
  their client app with your API product.</p>

  <figure class="attempt-right">
    <img class="screenshot"  src="/api-platform/images/apikey.png">
  </figure>

  <p>Upon registration, an app developer receives an API key
  that they must then include in every request to an API proxy included in the API product. That
  key is authenticated and, if authentication is successful, the request is allowed to access your
  backend service.</p>

  <p>At any time, you can revoke the key so that the client app no longer has access to your
  services. Or, you can define a time limit on a key so that the developer must refresh the key
  after a specific time.</p>

  <p>You decide how to handle registration requests from developers to access your API products. By
  using Apigee Edge Developer Services, you can automate the registration process; or you can use a
  manual process to control access.</p>

  <h3 id="create-products">Create API products and make them available to developers</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Create one or more API proxies that map publicly available URLs to your backend
      services.</li>
    <li>Create an API product that bundles your API proxies.</li>
    <li>Deploy your API proxies and API product.</li>
    <li>Let your developers know that the API product is available.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once app developers know about the availability of your API product, they:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Register their client apps with your API product.</li>
    <li>Receive an API key for the API product.</li>
    <li>Make requests to your services through API proxies (which are bundled in the API product)
      and pass the API key with each request.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="componentsofapigeeedge">Components of Apigee Edge</h2>

  <p>Apigee Edge consists of API runtime, monitoring and analytics, and developer services that
    together provide a comprehensive infrastructure for API creation, security, management,
    and operations.</p>

  <p>The following figure shows Edge services:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/EdgeServices_v3.png"></p>

  <h3 id="componentsofapigeeedge-edgeapiservices">Edge API runtime</h3>

  <p>Apigee Edge API Services are all about creating and consuming APIs, whether you're building
  API proxies as a service provider or using APIs, SDKs, and other convenience services as an app
  developer.</p>

  <p>On the API-building side, the API management server provides tools for adding and configuring
  your API proxies, setting up API products, and managing app developers and client apps. It
  offloads many common management concerns from your backend services. When you add an API proxy,
  you can apply policies to the API proxy for adding security, rate-limiting, mediation, caching,
  and so on. You can also customize the behavior of your API proxy by applying custom scripts,
  making calls out to third-party APIs and services, and so on. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies">Understanding APIs and API
  proxies</a> for more.</p>

  <p>On the API-consuming side, API Services powers mobile and Web apps by giving app developers
  access to a flexible data store and to key features such as social graphs, geolocation, user
  management, push notifications, performance monitoring, and more. These features, available with
  SDKs for iOS, Android, JavaScript, and others, let app developers focus on creating the rich
  features and user experience that truly differentiate a client app rather than burning time
  implementing core backend services and infrastructure. See <a href=
  "/api-baas/get-started/app-services-features.html">API BaaS features</a> for more.</p>

  <p>If you're a node.js developer, you can seamlessly add your node.js modules to Edge to create
  APIs and API mashups, all the while leveraging the benefits Edge provides, from message
  transformation to security to analytics.</p>

  <h3 id="componentsofapigeeedge-edgeanalyticsservices">Edge monitoring &amp; analytics</h3>

  <p>Apigee Edge Analytics Services provides powerful tools to see short- and long-term usage
  trends of your APIs. You can segment your audience by top developers and apps, understand usage
  by API method to know where to invest, and create custom reports on business- or
  operational-level information.</p>

  <p>As data passes through Edge, several default types of information are collected including URL,
  IP, user ID for API call information, latency, error data, and so on. You can create policies to
  add other information, such as headers, query parameters, and portions of a request or response
  extracted from XML or JSON. This information is collected asynchronously from the actual
  request/response flow and therefore has no effect on API performance.</p>

  <p>The management UI lets you view multiple metrics and dimensions in a browser, as shown in the
  following figure:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/new_edge_analytics.png" width="75%"></p>

  <p>However, you can also access and control the Analytics Service by a command-line interface or
  through RESTful APIs. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/analytics-services-overview">Analytics Services overview</a> for
  more.</p>

  <h3 id="componentsofapigeeedge-edgedeveloperservices">Edge developer ecosystem</h3>

  <p>Apigee Edge Developer Services provide the tools to manage the community of app developers
  using your services. Developer Services offers the flexibility to work with internal and external
  developers and formalize these relationships with financial models.</p>

  <p>Developer Services provides the ability to onboard developers and create a developer portal
  for your publicly available API products. App developers connect to your portal to access API
  documentation, forums, and a blog. Every Edge customer can create their own developer portal,
  either in the cloud or on-premises with Apigee Edge for Private Cloud.</p>

  <p>The following figure shows two flavors of Edge developer portals: <a href=
  "https://docs-new.apigee.com/index" class="external">New Edge</a> and Classic Edge.</p>

  <p><strong>New Edge portal</strong>, which can be instantly provisioned:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/new_portal_template.png" width="75%"></p>

  <p><strong>Classic Edge portal</strong>, based on the Drupal framework:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/portal-home-page_v24_1.png" width="75%"></p>

  <h2 id="monetization">Monetization</h2>

  <p>Monetization capabilities provide the financial infrastructure and relationships to turn your
  Developer community into an actual channel for your digital assets. With monetization, you can
  create a variety of <em>rate plans</em> that charge developers for the use of your API products or
  let you pay developers in revenue-sharing scenarios.</p>

  <p>Plans include pre-paid plans, post-paid plans,
  fixed-fee plans, variable rate plans, "freemium" plans, plans tailored to specific developers,
  plans covering groups of developers, and more. In addition, monetization includes reporting and
  billing facilities.

  <p>For more information, see <a href="/api-platform/monetization/basics-monetization">Understand
  monetization</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="cloudvonprem">Edge in the cloud vs. Edge on-premises</h2>

  <p>You can install Edge on-premises (<a href="/private-cloud">Apigee Edge for Private Cloud</a>)
  in your own environment to
  retain complete control of the environment and of the deployment taxonomies. Alternatively, you
  can use the cloud-hosted (SaaS) version where Apigee is responsible for maintaining the cloud
  environment for you, allowing you to concentrate on building your services and defining the API
  to those services.</p>

  <p>The functionality between the two versions is virtually identical. The difference is that the
  cloud supports both free and paid accounts, and that the hardware and software environment is
  managed by Apigee. With an on-premises installation, which requires a paid account, you are in
  complete control of Edge installation and deployment. To fully support an on-premises
  installation, Edge includes components such as the Apigee management server, an Apache Cassandra
  NoSQL database, an OpenLDAP server, a message Router, and a Message Processor.</p>
