  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}Creating an Apigee Edge account{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>You need an account to use Apigee Edge. You can create your own or an administrator can create
  one for you.</p>

  <p>For an overview of Apigee Edge, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/get-started/what-apigee-edge.html">What is Apigee Edge?</a></p>

  <h2 id="create">Create your own Apigee Edge account</h2>

  <p>Edge provides <a href="https://apigee.com/about/pricing/apigee-edge-pricing-features"
  target="_blank">different levels of accounts</a>, including a free evaluation. This section
  describes how to create a free evaluation account.</p>

  <p>When you create an Edge account, an <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/apigee-edge-organization-structure.html">organization</a> will be
  provisioned for you. An organization is a container for your API proxies and the environments you
  deploy them to (such as, "test" and "prod"). </p>

  <p>The organization name will be auto-generated based on your email address (minus the @domain)
  and end in <code>-eval</code>. If required, a 5-digit random number will be added to the
  organization name to ensure that it is unique. For example, if your email address is
  <code>joe@company.com</code>, the organization name for the evaluation account might be
  auto-generated as <code>joe-eval</code> or <code>joe-12345-eval</code>.</p>

  <p>To make calls to API proxies in your new Edge organization, you and your team of developers
  use a URL that includes your organization name and an environment name. For example:
  <code>http://&lt;your_org_name&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.apigee.net/path/to/resource</code></p>

  <p>You'll also use your organization name in the URL for any calls you make to the Edge
  management API, as described below in the <a href="#managementapi">What's next</a> section.</p>

  <p><strong>To create a free evaluation account and log in</strong>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://login.apigee.com/sign_up" target=
    "_blank">https://login.apigee.com/sign_up</a>.</li>

    <li>Enter the required information.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Create account</strong> (or <strong>Sign Up</strong>).</li>

    <li>A user account confirmation is sent to your email account. In the email you receive, click
    the <strong>account verification link</strong> to verify your email address.<br>
    After you click the email link, a browser tab is opened to the login page (<a href=
    "https://login.apigee.com/login">https://login.apigee.com/login</a>).</li>

    <li>Log in with the email and password that you used to sign up.<br>
    Your account is activated by Apigee and you are logged in to the Apigee Edge management UI.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, it may take a few minutes for activation to complete and
    you will see the following progress dialog. You may wish to review the tutorials, videos, or
    forums, while you wait.<br>
    <img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/activating-account.png"><br>
    <br>
    After your account is activated, the following message displays:<br>
    <img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/activation-complete.png"><br>
    Click <strong>Get Started</strong> to access the Edge Management UI.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Congratulations! You have a new Edge account and organization. The email used to set up the
  account is automatically added to the <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/edge-built-roles.html">Organization Administrator role</a>.
  That means you can do just about everything in your organization.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> By default, the <a href="https://docs-new.apigee.com" target="new">New Edge
    experience</a> is presented. To switch to the Classic Edge experience from New Edge, click
    <b>Switch to Classic</b> in the side navigation bar.

    <p>If when you log in your <a href="https://docs-new.apigee.com/personal-space" target=
    "_blank">personal space</a> is active, you need to select your new evaluation
    organization from the user profile drop-down menu. Note that it may take a few minutes for your
    new organization to appear in the drop-down menu.</p>

  <h2 id="whatsnext">What's next?</h2>

  <p>Now that you have a new Edge organization, you can get started building API proxies and
  infrastructure. You can also start using the Edge management API to manage your
  organization's API proxies and resources.</p>

  <p>And now that you're a registered Edge user, you can be added as an administrator to other
  organizations, where you can create API proxies and manage the API environment according to the
  role you're assigned. You can also add other Edge users as administrators to your organization.
  See <a href="/api-platform/system-administration/managing-organization-users.html">Managing
  organization users</a> for more information.</p>

  <h3 id="whatsnext-tutorials">Tutorials</h3>

  <p>A great way to get familiar with Edge is to run through some tutorials. Why not start with the
  {{gs_tutorial}}?</p>

  <h3 id="whatsnext-apiproxydevelopmentandconcepts">API proxy development and concepts</h3>

  <p>For an intro to API proxies and related Edge artifacts, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/get-started/video-concepts.html">Video concepts</a>. For a deeper dive into the
  anatomy of API proxies and proxy development, see the topics starting with <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies.html">Understanding APIs and API
  proxies</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="managementapi">Your organization and credentials in the management API</h3>

  <p>Using the Edge management API is a slightly advanced topic, but we mention it here because it
  involves the organization name credentials you've created. Your Edge email and password let you
  make calls to the Edge <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/apis/api-reference-getting-started.html">management API</a> (since
  you're automatically an Organization Administrator with permissions to do just about
  anything). </p>

  <p>For example, say you want to get a list of all your API proxies. You can make that management
  API call in a number of ways, such as in Postman, with <a href=
  "/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/apis">SmartDocs</a>, with cURL, and so on.
  Here's a cURL example:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}/apis -u email:password
</pre>

  <p>On each call, you must specify your organization name and include your Apigee email and
  password (currently with basic auth). The call above shows how your credentials are passed using
  cURL. With other API clients, enter your credentials in the appropriate place for basic auth.</p>

  <h3 id="whatsnext-findingyourorganizationname">Finding your organization name</h3>

  <p>After you create an organization, you can find its name in a few places:</p>

  <p><strong>In the URL of the Edge management UI</strong></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/organization-url-version2.png"></p>

  <p><strong>In the user profile drop-down</strong></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/organization-profile.png"></p>

  <h2 id="createanapigeeedgeaccountasanorganizationadministrator">Create an Apigee Edge account as
  an organization administrator</h2>

  <p>An organization administrator can add a new user account on Apigee Edge. The new user is
  automatically added to the administrator's organization. For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/managing-organization-users.html">Managing organization
  users</a>.</p>
