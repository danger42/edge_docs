  <p>In this topic, you will learn how to create a mashup using <em>policy composition</em>.
  Policy composition is an Apigee proxy pattern that lets you combine results from multiple backend
  targets into a single response using policies. </p>

  <h2 id="aboutthiscookbookexample">About this cookbook example</h2>

  <p>This cookbook example illustrates an API proxy pattern called <em>policy composition</em>.
  This pattern provides one way (there are others) to mash up data from multiple backend sources.
  More generally, this topic demonstrates how policies can be combined and chained together to
  produce a desired result. For a general overview of this pattern and other related ones, see
  <a href="/api-platform/samples/cookbook/api-proxy-cookbook-patterns.html">API Proxy Cookbook
  patterns</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> When using this API proxy, app developers may be unaware of
  where the backend data comes from. All an app developer knows about is how to call your API
  proxy. The details of how the data is retrieved and mashed up are not necessarily
  exposed.</aside>

  <p>The example discussed here uses policy composition to mash up data from these two separate
  public APIs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/">The Google Geocoding
    API</a>: This API converts addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA")
    into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739).</li>

    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/">The Google Elevation
    API</a> This API provides a simple interface to query locations on the earth for elevation
    data. In this example, the coordinates returned from the Geocoding API will be used as input
    into this API. </li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/policyComp1.png" width="480"></p>

  <p>App developers will call this API proxy with two query parameters, a postal code and a country
  ID:</p>

  <div id="well">
    <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl "http://{myorg}-test.apigee.net/policy-mashup-cookbook?country=us&amp;postalcode=08008"
</pre>

    <p>The response is a JSON object that includes the geocoded location (latitude/longitude) for
    the center of the supplied postal code area combined with the elevation at that geocoded
    location. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="well">
    <pre class="prettyprint">
{  
   "ElevationResponse":{  
      "status":"OK",
      "result":{  
         "location":{  
            "lat":"39.7500713",
            "lng":"-74.1357407"
         },
         "elevation":"0.5045232",
         "resolution":"76.3516159"
      }
   }
}
</pre>

    <h2 id="beforeyoubegin">Before you begin</h2>

    <p>If you'd like to read a brief overview of the policy composition pattern, see "The policy
    composition pattern" in <a href=
    "/api-platform/samples/cookbook/api-proxy-cookbook-patterns.html">API Proxy Cookbook
    patterns</a>.</p>

    <p>Before you explore this cookbook example, you should also be familiar with these fundamental
    concepts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What policies are and how to attach them to proxies. For a good introduction to policies,
      see <a href="/api-platform/develop/policy-attachment-and-enforcement.html">What's a
      policy?</a>. </li>

      <li>The structure of an API proxy flow, as explained in <a href=
      "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-configurations.html">Configuring flows</a>. Flows let you
      specify the sequence in which policies are executed by an API proxy. In this example, several
      policies are created and added to the API proxy's flow. </li>

      <li>How an API proxy project is organized on your filesystem, as explained in
      {{apiproxy_reference}}. This cookbook topic demonstrates local development (file
      system-based) as opposed to cloud-based development where you could use the management UI to
      develop the API proxy.</li>

      <li>A working knowledge of XML. In this example, we build out the API proxy and its
      policies with XML files that reside on the filesystem. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have downloaded the sample code, you can locate all of the files discussed in this
    topic in the <strong>mashup-policy-cookbook</strong> sample folder. The following sections
    discuss the sample code in detail. </p>

    <h2 id="goingwiththeflow">Going with the flow</h2>

    <p>Before moving to the policies, let's take a look a the main flow of our example
    API proxy. The flow XML, shown below, tells us a lot about this proxy, the policies it
    uses, and where those policies are called. </p>

    <p>In the sample download, you can find this XML in the file
    <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml</code>.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ProxyEndpoint name="default"&gt;
  &lt;Flows&gt;
    &lt;Flow name="default"&gt;
      &lt;Request&gt;
            &lt;!-- Generate request message for the Google Geocoding API --&gt;
            &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;GenerateGeocodingRequest&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
            &lt;!-- Call the Google Geocoding API --&gt;

            &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;AssignElevationParameters&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
      &lt;/Request&gt;
      &lt;Response&gt;
            &lt;!-- Parse the response message from the Elevation API --&gt;
            &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;ParseElevationResponse&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
            &lt;!-- Generate the final JSON-formatted response with JavaScript --&gt;
            &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;GenerateResponse&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
      &lt;/Response&gt;
    &lt;/Flow&gt;
  &lt;/Flows&gt;

  &lt;HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
    &lt;!-- Add a base path to the ProxyEndpoint for URI pattern matching--&gt;

    &lt;TargetEndpoint&gt;default&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
  &lt;/RouteRule&gt;
&lt;/ProxyEndpoint&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Here's a summary of the flow's elements.</p>

    <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> This is a ProxyEndpoint flow. The ProxyEndpoint
    configuration defines the inbound (app-facing) interface for an API proxy. When you configure a
    ProxyEndpoint, you define how apps invoke the proxied API.</aside>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>&lt;Request&gt;</strong> - The &lt;Request&gt; element consists of several
      &lt;Step&gt; elements. Each step calls one of the policies that we'll create through the rest
      of this topic. These policies are concerned with creating a request message, sending it, and
      parsing the response. By the end of this topic, you'll understand the role of each of these
      policies.</li>

      <li><strong>&lt;Response&gt;</strong> - The &lt;Response&gt; element also includes
      &lt;Steps&gt;. These steps also call policies that are responsible for processing the final
      response from the target endpoint (the Google Elevation API). </li>

      <li><strong>&lt;HttpProxyConnection&gt;</strong> - This element specifies details about
      how apps will connect to this API proxy, including the &lt;BasePath&gt;, which specifies how
      this API will be called. </li>

      <li><strong>&lt;RouteRule&gt;</strong> - This element specifies what happens immediately
      after the inbound request messages are processed. In this case, the TargetEndpoint is called.
      We'll discuss more about this important step later in this topic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="creatingthepolicies">Creating the policies</h2>

    <p>The following sections discuss each of the policies that make up this policy composition
    example. </p>

    <h3 id="creatingthepolicies-createthefirstassignmessagepolicy">Create the first AssignMessage
    policy</h3>

    <p>The first <a href=
    "/api-platform/reference/policies/assign-message-policy.html">AssignMessage</a> policy,
    listed below, creates a request message that will be sent to the Google Geocoding
    service. </p>

    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/policyComp2.png" width="480"></p>

    <p>Let's start with the policy code, and then we'll explain its elements in more detail. In the
    sample download, you can find this XML in the file
    <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/policies/GenerateGeocodingRequest.xml</code>.</p>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;AssignMessage name="GenerateGeocodingRequest"&gt;
  &lt;AssignTo createNew="true" type="request"&gt;GeocodingRequest&lt;/AssignTo&gt;
  &lt;Set&gt;
    &lt;QueryParams&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="address"&gt;{request.queryparam.postalcode}&lt;/QueryParam&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="region"&gt;{request.queryparam.country}&lt;/QueryParam&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="sensor"&gt;false&lt;/QueryParam&gt;
    &lt;/QueryParams&gt;
    &lt;Verb&gt;GET&lt;/Verb&gt;
  &lt;/Set&gt;
  &lt;!-- Set variables for use in the final response --&gt;
  &lt;AssignVariable&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;PostalCode&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;Ref&gt;request.queryparam.postalcode&lt;/Ref&gt;
  &lt;/AssignVariable&gt;
  &lt;AssignVariable&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;Country&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;Ref&gt;request.queryparam.country&lt;/Ref&gt;
  &lt;/AssignVariable&gt;
&lt;/AssignMessage&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Here's a brief description of the elements in this policy. You can read more about this
      policy in <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/assign-message-policy.html">Assign
      Message policy</a>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;AssignMessage name&gt;</strong> - Gives this policy a name. The name is
        used when the policy is referenced in a flow. </li>

        <li><strong>&lt;AssignTo&gt;</strong> - Creates a named variable called GeocodingRequest.
        This variable encapsulates the request object that will be sent to the backend by the
        ServiceCallout policy.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;QueryParams&gt;</strong> - Sets the query parameters that are needed by the
        backend API call. In this case, the Geocoding API needs to know the location, which is
        expressed with a postal code, and a country ID. The app user supplies this information, and
        we simply extract it here. The <code>sensor</code> param is required by the API, and is
        either true or false, and we just hardcode it to false here.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;Verb&gt;</strong> - In this case, we are making a simple GET request to the
        API.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;AssignVariable&gt;</strong> - These variables store the values we are
        passing to the API. In this example, the variables will be accessed later in the response
        returned to the client. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Send the request with ServiceCallout</h3>

      <p>The next step in the policy composition sequence is to create a <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/service-callout-policy.html">ServiceCallout</a> policy. The
      ServiceCallout policy, listed below, sends the request object that we created in the
      previous AssignMessage policy to the Google Geocoding service, and saves the result in a
      variable called GeocodingResponse. </p>
    </div>

    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/policyComp3.png" width="480"></p>

    <p>As before, let's take a look at the code first. A detailed explanation follows. You can read
    more about this policy in <a href=
    "/api-platform/reference/policies/service-callout-policy.html">Service Callout
    policy</a>. In the sample download, you can find this XML in the file
    <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/policies/ExecuteGeocodingRequest.xml</code>.</p>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ServiceCallout name="ExecuteGeocodingRequest"&gt;
  &lt;Request variable="GeocodingRequest"/&gt;
  &lt;Response&gt;GeocodingResponse&lt;/Response&gt;
  &lt;HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
    &lt;URL&gt;http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json&lt;/URL&gt;
  &lt;/HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
&lt;/ServiceCallout&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Here's a brief description of this policy's elements. </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;ServiceCallout&gt;</strong> - As with the previous policy, this one has a
        name. </li>

        <li><strong>&lt;Request variable&gt;</strong> - This is the variable that was created in
        the AssignMessage policy. It encapsulates the request going to the backend API.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;Response&gt;</strong> - This element names a variable in which the response
        is stored. As you will see, this variable will be accessed later by the ExtractVariables
        policy.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;HTTPTargetConnection&gt;</strong> - Specifies the target URL of the backend
        API. In this case, we specify that the API return a JSON response. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now we have two policies, one that specifies the request information needed to use the
      backend API (Google's Geocoding API), and the second one that actually sends the request to
      the backend API. Next, we'll handle the response. </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="creatingthepolicies-parsetheresponsewithextractvariables">Parse the response with
    ExtractVariables</h3>

    <p>The ExtractVariables policy provides a simple mechanism for parsing content from the
    response message obtained by a ServiceCallout policy. ExtractVariables can be used to parse
    JSON or XML, or it can be used to extract content from URI paths, HTTP headers, query
    parameters, and form parameters.</p>

    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/policyComp4.png" width="480"></p>

    <p>Here's a listing of the ExtractVariables policy. You can read more about this policy in
    <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/extract-variables-policy.html">Extract Variables
    policy</a>. In the sample download, you can find this XML in the file
    <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/policies/ParseGeocodingResponse.xml</code>.</p>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ExtractVariables name="ParseGeocodingResponse"&gt;
  &lt;Source&gt;GeocodingResponse&lt;/Source&gt;
  &lt;VariablePrefix&gt;geocoderesponse&lt;/VariablePrefix&gt;
  &lt;JSONPayload&gt;
    &lt;Variable name="latitude"&gt;
       &lt;JSONPath&gt;$.results[0].geometry.location.lat&lt;/JSONPath&gt;
    &lt;/Variable&gt;
    &lt;Variable name="longitude"&gt;
       &lt;JSONPath&gt;$.results[0].geometry.location.lng&lt;/JSONPath&gt;
    &lt;/Variable&gt;
  &lt;/JSONPayload&gt;
&lt;/ExtractVariables&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The key elements of the ExtractVariable policy are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;ExtractVariables name&gt;</strong> - Again, the policy name is used to
        refer to the policy when it is used in a flow. </li>

        <li><strong>&lt;Source&gt;</strong> - Specifies the response variable that we created in
        the ServiceCallout policy. This is the variable from which this policy extracts data.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;VariablePrefix&gt;</strong> - The variable prefix specifies a namespace for
        other variables created in this policy. The prefix can be any name, except for the reserved
        names defined by <a href="/api-platform/reference/variables-reference.html">Edge's
        predefined variables</a>.</li>

        <li><strong>&lt;JSONPayload&gt;</strong> - This element retrieves the response data that is
        of interest to us and puts it into named variables. In fact, the Geocoding API returns much
        more information than latitude and longitude. However, these are the only values we need
        for this sample. You can see a complete rendering of the JSON returned by the Geocoding API
        in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/">API's
        documentation</a>. The values of geometry.location.lat and geometry.location.lng are simply
        two of the many fields in the returned JSON object.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It may not be obvious, but it's important to see that ExtractVariables produces two
      variables whose names consist of the variable prefix (geocoderesponse) and the actual
      variable names that are specified in the policy. These variables are stored in the
      API proxy and will be available to other policies within the proxy flow, as you will
      see. The variables are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>geocoderesponse.latitude</li>

        <li>geocoderesponse.longitude</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most of the work is now done. We have created a composite of three policies that form a
      request, call a backend API, and parse the returned JSON data. In the final steps, we'll feed
      data from this part of the flow into another AssignMessage policy, call the second backend
      API (Google Elevation API), and return our mashed up data to the app developer. </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="creatingthepolicies-generatethesecondrequestwithassignmessage">Generate the second
    request with AssignMessage</h3>

    <p>The following AssignMessage policy uses variables returned from the first backend (Google
    Geocoding) that we stored, and plugs them into a request destined for the second API (Google
    Elevation). As noted previously, these variables are geocoderesponse.latitude and
    geocoderesponse.longitude. </p>

    <p>In the sample download, you can find this XML in the file
    <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/policies/AssignElevationParameters.xml</code>.</p>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;AssignMessage name="AssignElevationParameters"&gt;
&lt;Remove&gt;
    &lt;QueryParams&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="country"/&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="postalcode"/&gt;
    &lt;/QueryParams&gt;
  &lt;/Remove&gt;
  &lt;Set&gt;
    &lt;QueryParams&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="locations"&gt;{geocoderesponse.latitude},{geocoderesponse.longitude}&lt;/QueryParam&gt;
      &lt;QueryParam name="sensor"&gt;false&lt;/QueryParam&gt;
    &lt;/QueryParams&gt;
  &lt;/Set&gt;
&lt;/AssignMessage&gt;
</pre>

      <p>If you examine the Google Elevation API, you will see that it takes two query parameters.
      The first is called <code>locations</code> and its value is the latitude and longitude
      (comma-separated values). The other param is <code>sensor</code>, which is required and must
      be either true or false. The most important thing to note at this point is that the request
      message we create here does not require a ServiceCallout. We don't need to call the second
      API from a ServiceCallout at this point because we can call the backend API from the proxy's
      TargetEndpoint. If you think about it, we have all the data we need to call Google Elevations
      API The request message generated in this step does not require a ServiceCallout, as the
      request generated for the main request pipeline, and so will simply be forwarded by the
      ProxyEndpoint to the TargetEndpoint, following the RouteRule configured for this API proxy.
      The TargetEndpoint manages the connection with the remote API. (Recall that the URL for the
      elevation API is defined in the HTTPConnection for the TargetEndpoint. Elevation API
      documentation if you would like to know more. The QueryParams that we stored previously,
      <code>country</code> and <code>postalcode</code>, are no longer needed, so we remove them
      here. </p>

      <h3>Brief pause: Back to the flow</h3>

      <p>At this point, you may wonder why we aren't creating another ServiceCallout policy. After
      all, we created another message. How does that message get sent to the target, the Google
      Elevation API? The answer is in the &lt;RouteRule&gt; element of the flow. &lt;RouteRule&gt;
      specifies what to do with any remaining request messages after the &lt;Request&gt; part of
      the flow has executed. The TargetEndpoint specified by this &lt;RouteRule&gt; tells the
      API proxy to deliver the message
      to <code>http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/elevation/xml</code>. </p>

      <p>If you downloaded the sample API proxy, you can find the TargetProxy XML in the file
      <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/targets/default.xml</code>.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;TargetEndpoint name="default"&gt;
  &lt;HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
    &lt;!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. --&gt;
    &lt;URL&gt;http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/elevation/xml&lt;/URL&gt;
  &lt;/HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Now, we just need to process the response from the Google Elevation API and we're
      done. </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="creatingthepolicies-converttheresponsefromxmltojson">Convert the response from XML to
    JSON</h3>

    <p>In this example, the response from the Google Elevation API is returned as XML. For "extra
    credit," let's add one more policy to our composite to transform the response from XML to
    JSON.</p>

    <p>This example uses the JavaScript policy named GenerateResponse, with a resource file
    containing the JavaScript code, to perform the conversion. Shown below is
    the GenerateResponse policy definition:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;Javascript name="GenerateResponse" timeout="10000"&gt;
  &lt;ResourceURL&gt;jsc://GenerateResponse.js&lt;/ResourceURL&gt;
&lt;/Javascript&gt;
</pre>

    <p>The GenerateResponse.js resource file includes the JavaScript used to perform the
    conversion. You can see that code in the
    file <code>doc-samples/policy-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/resources/JSC/GenerateResponse.js</code>.</p>

    <p>Apigee also provides an out-of-the-box policy, XMLToJSON, to convert XML to JSON. You can
    edit the ProxyEndpoint to use the <code>xmltojson</code> policy shown below
    instead. </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;XMLToJSON name="xmltojson"&gt;
  &lt;Options&gt;
  &lt;/Options&gt;
  &lt;OutputVariable&gt;response&lt;/OutputVariable&gt;
  &lt;Source&gt;response&lt;/Source&gt;
&lt;/XMLToJSON&gt;
</pre>

    <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Don't forget to refer back to the section "Going with the
    flow" to see how all of these policies fit together!</aside>

    <strong>policy-mashup-cookbook</strong> sample, which you can find in the <a href=
    "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/doc-samples" target=
    "_blank">doc-samples folder</a> in the Apigee Edge samples repository GitHub. Just
    follow the instructions in the README file in the policy-mashup-cookbook folder. Or,
    follow the brief instructions here: <a href="/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using
    the sample API proxies</a>.</p>

    <p>To summarize, you can call the composite API as follows. Substitute your {myorg} with your
    organization name:</p>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl "http://{myorg}-test.apigee.net/policy-mashup-cookbook?country=us&amp;postalcode=08008"
</pre>

      <p>The response includes the geocoded location for the center of the postal code provided by
      the app end user, combined with the elevation at that geocoded location. The data was
      retrieved from two backend APIs, mashed up with policies attached to the API proxy, and
      returned to the client in a single response. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
{  
   "country":"us",
   "postalcode":"08008",
   "elevation":{  
      "meters":0.5045232,
      "feet":1.6552599030345978
   },
   "location":{  
      "latitude":39.75007129999999,
      "longitude":-74.1357407
   }
}
</pre>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

      <p>This cookbook topic explained how to use the policy composition pattern to create a mashup
      of data from multiple backend sources. Policy composition is a common pattern used in API
      proxy development for adding creative functionality to your API.</p>
