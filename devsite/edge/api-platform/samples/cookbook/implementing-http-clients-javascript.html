  <p>In this cookbook example, you will learn how to create a <strong>mashup</strong> by attaching
  a JavaScript HTTP client to a proxy. This useful pattern lets you combine results from multiple
  backend targets using JavaScript to process requests and responses.</p>

  <p>For a general overview of the HTTP client pattern, see "The JavaScript HTTP client pattern" in
  <a href="/api-platform/samples/cookbook/api-proxy-cookbook-patterns.html">API Proxy Cookbook

  <h2 id="aboutthiscookbookexample">About this cookbook example</h2>

  <p>This cookbook example illustrates an API proxy pattern that uses a JavaScript HTTP client
  object to call multiple backend services directly. As you will see, the JavaScript HTTP client
  code is attached as a policy to the ProxyEndpoint. In this case, the pattern does not require a
  TargetEndpoint; the HTTP client handles all communication with the backend targets. For a general
  overview of this pattern and other related ones, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/samples/cookbook/api-proxy-cookbook-patterns.html">API Proxy Cookbook
  patterns</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> When using this mashup API, app developers may be unaware of
  where the backend data comes from. All an app developer knows about is how to call your proxy.
  The details of how the data is retrieved and mashed up are not necessarily exposed.</aside>

  <p>The example discussed here uses a custom HTTP client written in JavaScript to mash up data
  from these two separate public APIs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/">The Google Geocoding
    API</a>: This API converts addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA")
    into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739).<br>
     </li>

    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/">The Google Elevation
    API</a>: This API provides a simple interface to query locations on the earth for
    elevation data. In this example, the coordinates returned from the Geocoding API will be used
    as input into this API. This is a typical pattern where APIs are chained together using
    proxies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/jsCookbook1.png" width="480"></p>

  <p>The API surfaced through this proxy to app developers takes two query parameters: a postal
  code and a country ID. An app developer calls this proxy API like this:</p>

  <div id="well">
    <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl "http://{myorg}-test.apigee.net/javascript-mashup-cookbook?country=us&amp;postalcode=80503"
</pre>

    <p>The response is a JSON object that includes the geocoded location (latitude/longitude) for
    the center of the supplied postal code area combined with the elevation at that geocoded
    location. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="well">
    <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "country": "us",
  "postalcode": 80503,

    <p>If you'd like to read a brief overview of the HTTP client pattern illustrated in this
    cookbook topic, see "The JavaScript HTTP client pattern" in <a href=
    "/api-platform/samples/cookbook/api-proxy-cookbook-patterns.html">API Proxy Cookbook
    patterns</a>.</p>

    <p>Before you explore this cookbook example, you should also be familiar with these fundamental
    concepts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What policies are and how to attach them to proxies. In this example, we build a single
      policy that wraps a JavaScript application. For a good introduction to policies, see <a href=
      "/api-platform/develop/policy-attachment-and-enforcement.html">What's a
      policy?</a>. </li>

      <li>The structure of an API proxy flow, as explained in <a href=
      "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-configurations.html">Configuring flows</a>. Flows let you
      specify the sequence in which policies are executed by an API proxy. In this example, a
      JavaScript policy is attached to the flow's ProxyEndpoint. </li>

      <li>How an API proxy project is organized on your filesystem, as explained in <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/api-proxy-configuration-reference.html">API proxy
      configuration reference</a>. This cookbook topic demonstrates local development (file
      system-based) as opposed to cloud-based development where you could use the management UI to
      develop the API proxy.</li>

      <li>As you will see, this example uses two out-of-the-box API platform components: variables
      and the Apigee JavaScript Object Model. If you'd like to review details about these
      components now, see <a href="/api-platform/reference/variables-reference.html">Variables
      reference</a> and <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/javascript-object-model.html">JavaScript object model</a>.</li>

      <li>A working knowledge of JavaScript and XML.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have downloaded the sample code, you can locate all of the files discussed in this
    topic in the <strong>mashup-policy-cookbook</strong> sample folder. The following sections
    discuss the sample code in detail. </p>

    <h2 id="goingwiththeflow">Going with the flow</h2>

    <p>Before moving to the JavaScript code, let's take a look a the main flow of our example API
    proxy. The flow XML, shown below, tells us a lot about this API proxy, and how the JavaScript
    application is integrated into the flow. </p>

    <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The important thing to notice about this API proxy is that the
    TargetEndpoint definition is not invoked by the RouteRule. In this case, the JavaScript
    application itself handles all of the mashup activities and populates the response object. No
    further processing in the API proxy "pipeline" is required. </aside>

    <p>If you downloaded the sample from GitHub, you can find this API proxy definition in the file
    <code>doc-samples/javascript-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml</code>.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;ProxyEndpoint name="default"&gt;
  &lt;Flows&gt;
    &lt;Flow name="default"&gt;
      &lt;Request/&gt;
      &lt;Response&gt;
        &lt;!-- Call the JavaScript that invokes both APIs and returns a response --&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;MashItUp&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
      &lt;/Response&gt;
    &lt;/Flow&gt;
  &lt;/Flows&gt;

  &lt;HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
    &lt;!-- Add a base path to the proxy to distinguish from others in the environment --&gt;
    &lt;BasePath&gt;/javascript-mashup-cookbook&lt;/BasePath&gt;
    &lt;VirtualHost&gt;default&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
  &lt;/HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
  &lt;RouteRule name="default"&gt;
    &lt;!-- No route. The proxy will return the request and not call a backend service. --&gt;
  &lt;/RouteRule&gt;
&lt;/ProxyEndpoint&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Here's a summary of the flow's elements:</p>

    <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> This is a ProxyEndpoint flow. The ProxyEndpoint
    configuration defines the inbound (app-facing) interface for an API proxy. When you configure a
    ProxyEndpoint, you define how apps invoke the proxied API.</aside>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>&lt;Request&gt;</strong> - This API proxy does not use the &lt;Request&gt;
      element of the flow. In this pattern, the request is handled within the JavaScript
      application itself.</li>

      <li><strong>&lt;Response&gt;</strong> - The response part of the pipeline simply calls the
      JavaScript application, which handles the request from the client and all of the backend API
      calls. </li>

      <li><strong>&lt;HttpProxyConnection&gt;</strong> - Specifies details about how apps will
      connect to this API proxy, including the &lt;BasePath&gt;, which specifies how this API will
      be called. </li>

      <li><strong>&lt;RouteRule&gt;</strong> - The interesting thing about the
      &lt;RouteRule&gt; is that we don't specify one! That is, we don't specify a TargetEndpoint to
      invoke with &lt;RouteRule&gt;. With this pattern, there is no need to call the
      TargetEndpoint. The JavaScript application creates a response object that is returned to the
      client app. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="codingthejavascriptapplication">Coding the JavaScript application</h2>

    <p>Here's the complete listing of our example JavaScript application. For the most part, it is
    straightforward JavaScript, with some Apigee-specific objects and variables mixed in. For

    <div>
      As mentioned previously, this code includes Apigee-specific variables and objects. The
      variables are included through the API proxy runtime environment. They include
      <strong>request</strong>, <strong>response</strong>, <strong>request.queryParams</strong>,
      <strong>response.content</strong>, and <strong>response.headers</strong>. These variables are
      populated whenever an app submits a request to the API proxy. For more information about
      variables and how they participate in the API proxy environment, see <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/variables-reference.html">Variables reference</a>.
    </div>

    <div>
       
    </div>

    <p>The other Apigee-specific object is <strong>httpClient</strong> (Apigee's JavaScript
    HTTP Client). This object is part of the Apigee JavaScript Object Model. This object model
    defines request, response, and context objects with associated properties. It's purpose in this
    example is to make requests to backend services (the Google APIs) and return responses from
    those services. As with variables, the HTTP client is made available out-of-the-box to
    JavaScript applications that are deployed in an API proxy. For more detailed information
    on httpClient, see <a href="/api-platform/reference/javascript-object-model.html">JavaScript
    object model</a>.</p>

    this related post</a> on the Apigee community. </aside>

    <h2 id="creatingthejavascriptpolicy">Creating the JavaScript policy</h2>

    <p>To work within the context of an API proxy, we need to wrap the JavaScript application in a
    policy. The proxy references this policy at the point of attachment and immediately executes
    the JavaScript. (If you wish, refer back to the section "Going with the flow" to see where this
    policy is attached to the flow.)</p>

    <p>If you downloaded the sample from GitHub, you can find this policy in the file
    <code>doc-samples/javascript-mashup-cookbook/apiproxy/policies/MashItUp.xml</code>.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;JavaScript name="MashItUp" timeout="10000"&gt;
    &lt;ResourceURL&gt;jsc://MashItUp.js&lt;/ResourceURL&gt;
&lt;/JavaScript&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Just a policy name and a reference to the JavaScript source file. Pretty simple.  </p>

    <h2 id="testingtheexample">Testing the example</h2>

    <p>If you have not already done so, try to download, deploy, and run the
    <strong>javascript-mashup-cookbook</strong> sample, which you can find in the <a href=
    "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/doc-samples" target=
    "_blank">doc-samples folder</a> in the Apigee Edge samples repository on GitHub. Just
    follow the instructions in the README file in
    the <strong>javascript-mashup-cookbook</strong> folder. Or, follow the brief
    instructions here: <a href="/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using the sample API
    proxies</a>.</p>

    <p>To summarize, you can call the API as follows. Substitute your {myorg} with your
    organization name:</p>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl "http://{myorg}-test.apigee.net/javascript-mashup-cookbook?country=us&amp;postalcode=80503"
</pre>

      <p>The response is a JSON object that includes the geocoded location (latitude/longitude) for
      the center of the supplied postal code area combined with the elevation at that geocoded
      location. It also includes a conversion of the elevation from meters to feet. The data
      was retrieved from two backend APIs, mashed up inside the JavaScript application, massaged a
      bit, and returned to the client in a single response. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="well">
      <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "country": "us",
  "postalcode": 80503,
  "location": {
    "latitude": 40.1724007,
    "longitude": -105.1960795
  },
  "altitude": {
    "meters": 1570.249755859375,

  }
}
</pre>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

      <p>This cookbook topic explained how to attach an HTTP client written in JavaScript to an
      Apigee API proxy. One use for a pattern like this is to create a mashup of data pulled from
      multiple backend services. At the same time, because the JavaScript is attached to the API
      proxy as a policy, it can participate in Apigee Edge features like traffic management,
      security, mediation, and analytics.</p>
