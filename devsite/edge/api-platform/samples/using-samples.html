  <h2 id="downloadingthesamples">Downloading the samples</h2>

  <p>To obtain the sample files, run:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples.git
</pre>

  <h2 id="importinganddeployingthesampleapiproxies">Importing and deploying the sample API
  proxies</h2>

  <p>Import and deploy the samples from the command line:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>After you download the samples, go to the <code>/setup</code> directory.
      <pre class="terminal">
$ cd setup
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>In the <code>/setup</code> directory, locate the file <code>setenv.sh</code>. Edit this
    file to set your organization, the email address associated with your username, and the
    environment (prod or test) where you want to deploy the API proxies.  </li>

    <li>After you edit <code>setenv.sh</code>, run:
      <pre class="terminal">
$ sh deploy_all.sh
</pre>This script deploys all API proxy samples to your organization. (The process takes 3-4
minutes.) Follow prompts to deploy API products, developers, and apps (which are used for OAuth).
 
    </li>

    <li>After the deploy script completes, navigate to the sample-proxies directory. In the
    directory <code>sample-proxies</code>, you will find one directory per sample proxy. In each
    directory is a README.md file with information about running the sample, and two scripts that
    help you as you make small changes to the samples, deploy, and then invoke the sample to see
    what effect you change had:

      <ul>
        <li><code>invoke.sh</code>: Run this script to invoke the deployed version of the API
        proxy.</li>

        <li><code>deploy.sh</code>: Run this script to deploy the API proxy after you make any
        changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="invokingthesampleapiproxies">Invoking the sample API proxies</h2>

  <p>Each sample proxy has an associated shell script that can be used to invoke the API proxy
  after you deploy it.</p>

  <p>From the <code>/sample-proxies/{proxy_name}</code> directory, run:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ sh invoke.sh
</pre>

  <p>This will invoke the proxy that is running in the test environment in your organization.</p>

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

  <p>If you run into issue with the sample, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-introduction.html">Troubleshooting introduction</a>.
  The topic includes a <a href=
  "/api-platform/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-introduction.html#cygwin">Windows/Cygwin
  Troubleshooting</a> section for fixing deployment errors in Cygwin on Windows.</p>

  <h2 id="modifyingandreusingthesampleapiproxies">Modifying and reusing the sample API proxies</h2>

  <p>Typical usage of the sample proxies is to modify, deploy, and invoke. This enables you to make
  small modifications, and then to see what effect they have on the response message.</p>

  <p>If you need to modify a sample API proxy to point at a different backend service, modify the
  XML configuration file under:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
/apiproxy/targets/{target_name}.xml
</pre>

  <p>For example, to point the API key sample at your own backend service, locate this file:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
/apikey/apiproxy/targets/default.xml
</pre>

  <p>If the default configuration points to <code>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</code>, such as:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;TargetEndpoint name="default"&gt;
  &lt;HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
    &lt;!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. --&gt;
    &lt;URL&gt;http://mocktarget.apigee.net&lt;/URL&gt;
  &lt;/HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
</pre>

  <p>and your backend service is available at <code>http://api.myproject.com/</code>, then you
  modify the configuration to look like the following:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;TargetEndpoint name="default"&gt;
  &lt;HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
    &lt;!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. --&gt;
    &lt;URL&gt;http://api.myproject.com/&lt;/URL&gt;
  &lt;/HTTPTargetConnection&gt;
&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
</pre>After you have saved your changes, deploy the API proxy:
  <pre class="terminal">
$ sh deploy.sh
</pre>

  <p>The other API proxies can be modified the same way in order to use the API proxy functionality
  against your existing target services. In some cases, however, API proxy behavior is dependent on
  specific message formats, so the proxies might need additional configuration changes.</p>{% endblock %}
