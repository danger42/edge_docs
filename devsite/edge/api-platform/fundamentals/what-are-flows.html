  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}Controlling how a proxy executes with flows{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>Any application programming model includes a way to control the flow of processing. In an API
  proxy, that's done with flows. To flows you add logic, condition statements, error handling, and
  so on. You use flows to control what happens, and when.</p>

  <p>Flows are sequential stages along the API request processing path. When you add proxy logic,
  such as to verify an API key, you add the logic as a step in the sequence specified by a flow.
  When you define a condition to specify whether and when logic executes, you add the condition to
  a flow.</p>

  <p>The following flow configuration example defines a flow in which the VerifyAPIKey policy
  executes <em>if</em> the incoming request path ends with <code>/</code> and the request's HTTP
  verb is GET.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;Flow name="Get Food Carts"&gt;
    &lt;Description&gt;Get Food Carts&lt;/Description&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Verify-API-Key&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/") and (request.verb = "GET")&lt;/Condition&gt;
&lt;/Flow&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The <code>Verify-API-Key</code> value in the flow's <code>&lt;Name&gt;</code> element serves
  to include a policy configured elsewhere in the proxy with XML such as the following:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;VerifyAPIKey async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Verify-API-Key"&gt;
    &lt;DisplayName&gt;Verify API Key&lt;/DisplayName&gt;
    &lt;Properties/&gt;
    &lt;APIKey ref="request.header.x-api-key"/&gt;
&lt;/VerifyAPIKey&gt;
</pre>

  <h2 id="designingflowexecutionsequence">Designing flow execution sequence</h2>

  <p>You structure flows so that you can have logic execute in the right sequence along the
  processing path.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> See {{gs_tutorial}} for a simple
  tutorial on creating a flow. For specifics on configuring flows, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-configurations.html">Configuring flows</a>.</aside>

  <p>When deciding where to add logic, you'll first choose whether to add it to a proxy endpoint or
  target endpoint. An API proxy divides its code between code that interacts with the proxy's
  client (proxy endpoint) and optional code that interacts with the proxy's backend target, if any
  (target endpoint).</p>

  <p>Both endpoints contain flows, as described here:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Endpoint type</th>

        <th>Description</th>

        <th>Flows supported</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>ProxyEndpoint</td>

        <td>Contains the API proxy flows closest to the client. Provides places for logic to act
        first on the request from the client, then last on the response to the client.</td>

        <td>PreFlow, conditional flows, PostFlow, PostClientFlow</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>TargetEndpoint</td>

        <td>Contains the API proxy flows closest to the backend resource. Provides places for logic
        to prepare a request for, then handle the response from, a backend resource. </td>

        <td>PreFlow, conditional flows, PostFlow</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>You configure flow with XML that specifies what should happen and in what order. The following
  illustration shows how flows are ordered sequentially within a proxy endpoint and target
  endpoint:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/ProxyToBackendWithFlows_v3.png"></p>

  <p>The proxy endpoint and target endpoint each contain flows that you can arrange in the
  following sequence:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Position</th>

        <th>Flow type</th>

        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>

        <td>PreFlow</td>

        <td>
          <p>Useful when you need to make sure that certain code executes before anything else
          happens.</p>

          <p>If the PreFlow is in a target endpoint, it executes after the proxy endpoint's
          PostFlow.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>2</td>

        <td>Conditional Flow</td>

        <td>
          <p>The place for conditional logic. Executes after the PreFlow and before the
          PostFlow.</p>

          <div>
            Only one conditional flow is executed per segment--the first flow whose condition
            evaluates to true. That means you can have one conditional flow executed as part of
            each of the:
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li>ProxyEndpoint's request pipeline</li>

            <li>TargetEndpoint's request pipeline</li>

            <li>ProxyEndpoint's response pipeline</li>

            <li>TargetEndpoint's response pipeline</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>3</td>

        <td>PostFlow</td>

        <td>
          <p>A good place to need to log data, send a notification that something happened while
          processing the request, and so on. Executes after conditional flows and PreFlow.</p>

          <p>If the PostFlow is in a proxy endpoint, and there's a target endpoint, the proxy
          endpoint PostFlow executes before the target endpoint PreFlow.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>4</td>

        <td>PostClientFlow (proxy flow only)</td>

        <td>A flow for logging messages after a response is returned to the client.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3 id="designingflowexecutionsequence-havingcodeexecutefirstwithapreflow">Having code execute
  first with a PreFlow</h3>

  <p>A PreFlow is useful when you need to make sure that certain code executes before anything else
  happens.</p>

  <p>In a proxy endpoint, a PreFlow is a great place for code that authenticates a client and
  limits traffic from clients. In a target endpoint, where it begins preparing to send a request to
  a backend target, a PreFlow is good for first steps in preparing to send the request.</p>

  <p>For example, you usually don't want to service a client that has exceeded its quota. To
  support these requirements, you put security and quota policies in the PreFlow segment. That way,
  you don't need to worry about a condition failing to evaluate in a later conditional flow. The
  policies in this flow will always execute before any other processing takes place.</p>

  <p>In the following example, SpikeArrest and Quota policies execute before processing passes to
  conditional flows.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;PreFlow name="MyPreFlow"&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Spike-Arrest&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Quota&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
    &lt;Response/&gt;
&lt;/PreFlow&gt;
</pre>

  <h3 id="designingflowexecutionsequence-havingcodeexecuteconditionallywithaconditionalflow">Having
  code execute conditionally with a conditional flow</h3>

  <p>Between a PreFlow and a PostFlow, you can have flows that execute conditionally. This gives
  you an opportunity to configure multiple sequences of logic, but have only one execute based on
  your proxy's state. A conditional flow is optional if you can execute all logic in PreFlow or
  PostFlow and no conditions are required (in other words, only one path through the endpoint is
  supported).</p>

  <p>Each flow specifies a condition that tests for different state values. This effectively
  branches execution based on conditions. For example, you might want to convert XML to JSON only
  when the requesting app is running on a mobile device.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In a conditional flow, the condition is evaluated in both the
  request and response. You cannot have separate conditions for request and response. Only one
  conditional flow is executed--the first flow whose condition evaluates to true.</aside>

  <p>Here, quota constraints are enforced only if the request is a <code>GET</code> request with a
  URI pattern of <code>/issue/**</code> (/issue/ with anything in the URI after the last forward
  slash).</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;Flow name="MyFlow"&gt;
    &lt;Description/&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Quota&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
    &lt;Response/&gt;
    <strong>&lt;Condition&gt;(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/issue/**") and (request.verb = "GET")&lt;/Condition&gt;</strong>
&lt;/Flow&gt;
</pre>

  <p>You use flow variables to specify conditions. For more about using variables in conditions,
  see <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-variables-and-conditions.html">Flow variables and
  conditions</a>.</p>

  <p>For examples of using pattern matching in conditions, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/pattern-matching-conditional-statements.html">Pattern matching in
  conditional statements</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="designingflowexecutionsequence-havingcodeexecuteaftercorelogicwithapostflow">Having code
  execute after core logic with a PostFlow</h3>

  <p>A PostFlow is a great place to perform actions after your endpoint's core logic, and before
  endpoint processing finishes. A PostFlow executes after conditional flows and PreFlow.</p>

  <p>A PostFlow is a good place to log some data, send a notification that something happened,
  transform the response message format, and so on.</p>

  <p>In the following example, an AssignMessage policy called SetResponseHeaders sets headers of
  the response message before Apigee Edge sends the response back to the client.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;PostFlow&gt;
    &lt;Response&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;SetResponseHeaders&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Response&gt;
 &lt;/PostFlow&gt;
</pre>

  <h3 id=
  "designingflowexecutionsequence-havingcodeexecuteaftertheclientreceivesyourproxysresponsewithapostclientflow">
  Having code execute after the client receives your proxy's response with a PostClientFlow</h3>

  <p>A PostClientFlow can include only MessageLogging policies. If you include one, a
  PostClientFlow would be the last flow to execute, executing after a response is sent to the
  client.</p>

  <p>A PostClientFlow is good for final logging. Also, you can log the time interval between when
  the start and end timestamps for the response message. The <code>client.send.start.time</code>
  and <code>client.send.end.time</code> variable values aren't calculated until after the response
  is sent.</p>

  <h2 id="addinglogictoflows">Adding logic to flows</h2>

  <p>When you add logic to your proxy, you do it by adding policies to your proxy's flows. Just as
  flows execute in a sequence (PreFlow then Flow then PostFlow, as described in this topic), the
  contents of a flow execute in a sequence.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> For more about policies, including how to add them with the
  console and in code, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/develop/policy-attachment-and-enforcement.html">What's a policy?</a> For details
  about attaching policies to flows, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-configurations.html">Configuring flows</a>.</aside>

  <p>The following example flow configuration references three policies (configured elsewhere in
  their own XML files). The policy referenced by <code>Verify-API-Key</code> executes before the
  policy referenced by <code>Remove-API-Key</code>; both are followed by the policy represented by
  <code>Quota</code>.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;Flow name="Get Food Cart Menus"&gt;
    &lt;Description&gt;Get Food Cart Menus&lt;/Description&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Verify-API-Key&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Remove-API-Key&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;Quota&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/") and (request.verb = "GET")&lt;/Condition&gt;
&lt;/Flow&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The Apigee Edge console present this sequence of policies as a row of icons, where each icon
  represents the policy.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/flow-policy-sequence.png"></p>

  <h2 id="debuggingflows">Debugging flows</h2>

  <p>The Apigee Edge Trace tool provides a graphical way to see how the logic in your API proxy
  executes following a request. The tool illustrates processing between request and response. It
  doesn't specifically illustrate the separation between PreFlow, conditional flows, and
  PostFlow.</p>

  <p>For more about tracing proxies, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html">Using the Trace tool</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="handlingerrorsinflows">Handling errors in flows</h2>

  <p>You can raise faults from various places in an API proxy, including from flows.</p>

  <p>The following example is the response stanza from a PreFlow in a target endpoint -- in other
  words, it's the code that executes immediately upon receiving the response from a backend target.
  In the example, a fault is raised if the response from the target isn't 200 (success).</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;PreFlow name="PreFlow"&gt;
    &lt;Response&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;
            &lt;Name&gt;RaiseFault&lt;/Name&gt;
            &lt;Condition&gt;(response.status.code GreaterThan "200")&lt;/Condition&gt;
