{% block body %}

  <p>Any application programming model includes a way to control the flow of processing. In an API
  proxy, that's done with flows. To flows you add logic, condition statements, error handling, and
  so on. You use flows to control what happens, and when.</p>

  <p>Flows are sequential stages along the API request processing path. When you add proxy logic,
  such as to verify an API key, you add the logic as a step in the sequence specified by a flow.
  When you define a condition to specify whether and when logic executes, you add the condition to
  a flow.</p>

  <p>The following illustration shows how flows are ordered sequentially within a proxy endpoint
  and target endpoint:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/ProxyToBackendWithFlows_v3.png"></p>

  <p>To configure flows, use XML-based configuration files. The following example executes the
  {{spike_arrest_policy}} policy during the proxy endpoint's PreFlow:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/simple-1.xml"%}</pre>

  <p>The "Spike-Arrest-1" value references a policy that you configured elsewhere in the
  proxy.</p>

  <p>Flows can also contain conditional statements, so that the policies in a flow are executed
  only when certain conditions are met. The following example flow configuration executes a
  {{verify_api_key_policy}} <em>only if</em>
  the request's HTTP verb is "GET":</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/conditional-1.xml"%}</pre>

  <p>For more information, see <a href="flow-variables-and-conditions">Conditions with flow
  variables</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="addinglogictoflows">Adding logic to flows</h2>

  <p>To add logic to your proxy, add policies to your proxy's flows. Just as
  flows execute in a sequence (PreFlow -&gt; Flows -&gt; PostFlow, as described in this topic), the
  contents of a flow execute in a sequence.</p>

  <p>The following example shows how a request might be processed, based on the structure of your
  flow configuration:</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/flows/simple-proxyendpoint-flow-diagram.png" class="screenshot"/></p>

  <p>To add a policy to a flow, use one {{step}} element for each policy within a {{request}} or
  {{response}}.</p>

  <p>The following example flow configuration references three policies (configured elsewhere in
  their own XML files). The policies execute in order ("Verify-API-Key" first, followed by
  "Remove-API-Key", followed by "My-Quota".</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/multiple-steps-1.xml"%}</pre>

  <p>The Apigee Edge console presents this sequence of policies as a row of icons, in which each
  icon represents a policy in the flow, in order:</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/flow-policy-sequence.png"></p>

  <p>Edge comes with many different types of predefined policies to implement security, manage
  traffic, and manipulate messages. In addition, policies let you add your own custom code to
  completely customize message processing.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Attach an {{oauthv2_policy}} to the <strong>request PreFlow of the ProxyEndpoint</strong>.
      Because the ProxyEndpoint's request PreFlow is the first flow in the pipeline, you can
      immediately reject a request if it violates your security policies.</li>
    <li>Attach a {{json_to_xml_policy}} to the <strong>response PostFlow of the
      TargetEndpoint</strong> to convert a response from JSON to XML.</li>
    <li>Attach a {{javascript_policy}} to a <strong>Conditional Flow of the ProxyEndpoint</strong>
      to execute JavaScript code to process the request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="designingflowexecutionsequence">Where to add policies</h2>

  <p>You structure flows so that you can have logic execute in the right sequence along the
  processing path.</p>

<p><strong>When deciding where in the proxy flow to add your policies:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>First, choose the segment you want to add the policy to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Request:</strong> Execute logic on objects related to the request. This often includes
        authentication, quotas, and using request properties such as form and query string
        parameters to determine which policies to execute.</li>
      <li><strong>Response:</strong> Execute logic on objects related to the response. This often includes
        fault handling, logging, and transforming the response before sending it back to the
        client.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next, choose the endpoint you want to target:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ProxyEndpoint:</strong> Code that interacts with the proxy's client. Contains the flows closest to
        the client. You can use policies that act <em>first</em> on the request from the client,
        and <em>last</em> on the response to the client.</li>
      <li><strong>TargetEndpoint:</strong> Code that interacts with the proxy's backend target. Contains the flows
        closest to the backend resource. Provides a place for you to add logic that prepares a
        request for, then handles the response from, a backend resource.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, choose the flow in which to execute your policy:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#preflow">PreFlow</a>: <strong>Executes code first</strong>. Useful when you need
        to make sure that
        certain code executes before anything else happens.
        <p>If the PreFlow is in a TargetEndpoint, it executes after the proxy endpoint's
        PostFlow.</p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#conditionalflow">Conditional Flow</a>: <strong>Conditional logic</strong> that
        executes after the PreFlow and before the PostFlow.
        <p>Only one conditional flow is executed per segment--the first flow whose condition
        evaluates to true.</p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#postflow">PostFlow</a>: <strong>After core logic</strong> is a good place to log
        data, send a notification that something happened while processing the request, and so on.
        Executes after conditional flows and PreFlow.
        <p>If the PostFlow is in a proxy endpoint, and there's a target endpoint, the proxy
        endpoint PostFlow executes before the target endpoint PreFlow.</p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#postclientflow">PostClientFlow</a> (ClientEndpoint only): <strong>After the
        proxy's response</strong>.
        <p>A flow for logging messages after a response is returned to the client.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <h3 id="preflow">About the PreFlow</h3>

  <p>A PreFlow is useful when you need to make sure that certain code executes before anything else
  happens.</p>

  <p>In a proxy endpoint, a PreFlow is a great place for code that authenticates a client and
  limits traffic from clients. In a target endpoint, where it begins preparing to send a request to
  a backend target, a PreFlow is good for first steps in preparing to send the request.</p>

  <p>For example, you usually don't want to service a client that has exceeded its quota. To
  support these requirements, you put security and quota policies in the PreFlow segment. That way,
  you don't need to worry about a condition failing to evaluate in a later conditional flow. The
  policies in this flow will always execute before any other processing takes place.</p>

  <p>In the following example, SpikeArrest and Quota policies execute before processing passes to
  conditional flows.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/preflow-1.xml"%}</pre>

  <h3 id="conditionalflow">About Conditional Flows</h3>

  <p>Between a PreFlow and a PostFlow, you can have flows that execute conditionally called the
  <em>Conditional Flow</em>. The Conditional Flow uses the {{flows_link}} element.</p>

  <p>Conditional Flows provide
  you an opportunity to configure multiple sequences of logic, but have only one execute based on
  your proxy's state. A Conditional Flow is optional if you can execute all logic in PreFlow or
  PostFlow and no conditions are required (in other words, only one path through the endpoint is
  supported).</p>

  <p>Within a Conditional Flow, you can define multiple {{flow_link}} elements. Each flow specifies
  a condition that tests for different state values. This effectively
  branches execution based on conditions. For example, you might want to convert XML to JSON,
  but only when the requesting app is running on a mobile device.</p>

  <aside class="note"><h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3>In a Conditional Flow, the condition is
  evaluated in both the request and response. You cannot have separate conditions for the request
  and response. Only one flow is executed--the first flow whose condition evaluates to true.</aside>

  <p>Here, quota constraints are enforced only if the request is a <code>GET</code> and the request
  uses a URI pattern that matches <code>/issue/**</code> (e.g., "/issue/" with anything in the URI
  after the last forward slash).</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/quota-with-conditions.xml"%}</pre>

  <p>You use flow variables to specify conditions. For more about using variables in conditions,
  see <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-variables-and-conditions">Flow variables and
  conditions</a>.</p>

  <p>When defining your conditional flows, you can also define a default flow that executes only
  if no other flow executes.</p>

  <aside class="key-point">
    <h3 id="defaultflow" class="hide-from-toc">Best Practice</h3>Apigee recommends that you define a
    default flow if your Conditional Flows are explicitely declared endpoints. The default flow will
    intercept and/or report all other requests that a potential hacker might use to enumerate
    undeclared endpoints that might exist at the backend.
  </aside>

  <h3 id="postflow">About the PostFlow</h3>

  <p>A PostFlow is a great place to perform actions after your endpoint's core logic, and before
  endpoint processing finishes. A PostFlow executes after Conditional Flows and PreFlow. Actions
  that you might execute in a PostFlow include logging data, sending notifications, transforming
  the response message format, and so on.</p>

  <p>In the following example, a policy named "set-response-header" executes before Apigee Edge
  sends the response back to the client:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/set-response-header.xml"%}</pre>

  <h3 id="postclientflow">About the PostClientFlow</h3>
  <p><strong>Element:</strong> {{postclientflow_link}}</p>
  <p><strong>Scopes:</strong> ProxyEndpoint only</p>

  <p>A PostClientFlow is good for final logging. Also, you can log the time interval between when
  the start and end timestamps for the response message. The <code>client.send.start.time</code>
  and <code>client.send.end.time</code> variable values aren't calculated until after the response
  is sent.</p>

  <p>A PostClientFlow can only include the {{message_logging_policy}}. If you include one, a
  PostClientFlow would be the last flow to execute, executing after a response is sent to the
  client.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of a PostClientFlow with a message logging policy attached:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/fundamentals/examples/flows/pcf-with-logging.xml"%}</pre>

  <p>The Apigee Edge Trace tool provides a graphical way to see how the logic in your API proxy
  executes following a request. The tool illustrates processing between request and response. It
  doesn't specifically illustrate the separation between PreFlow, conditional flows, and
  PostFlow.</p>

  "/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html">Using the Trace tool</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="handlingerrorsinflows">Handling errors in flows</h2>

  <p>You can raise faults from various places in an API proxy, including from flows.</p>

  <p>The following example is the response stanza from a PreFlow in a target endpoint -- in other
  words, it's the code that executes immediately upon receiving the response from a backend target.
  In the example, a fault is raised if the response from the target isn't 200 (success).</p>
