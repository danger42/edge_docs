  <p>You can combine policies and resources into a <i>shared flow</i> that you can consume from
  multiple API proxies, and even from other shared flows. Although it's like a proxy, a shared flow
  has no endpoint. It can be used only from an API proxy or shared flow that's in the same
  organization as the shared flow itself.</p>

  <p>By capturing in one place functionality that's useful in multiple places, a shared flow helps
  you ensure consistency, shorten development time, and more easily manage code.</p>

  <p>The following 5-minute video demonstrates how to create and trace a shared flow in the Classic
  Edge UI.</p>

  <p>The following video demonstrates how to create and trace a shared flow in the New Edge
  experience.</p>

  <p>You can call a shared flow using the Flow Callout policy. Also, by attaching a shared flow to
  a <i>flow hook</i>, you can have the shared flow execute before a proxy or target request, or
  after a proxy or target response.</p>

  <p>For reference on the Flow Callout policy, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/flow-callout-policy.html">Flow Callout policy</a>. For more on
  flow hooks, see <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-hooks.html">Attaching a shared flow
  using a flow hook</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, imagine you have areas of functionality that are either used in multiple places
  or must be standardized across APIs in your organization. You could have a shared flow for each
  category, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>security</b>, with authorization code using OAuth and API key verification, as well as
    threat protection code.</li>

    <li><b>logging</b>, for generating standard error messages.</li>

    <li><b>mediation</b>, for transforming between XML and JSON message formats.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the following illustration, two API proxies call out (with a FlowCallout policy) to a
  shared flow to authenticate incoming user requests. The AuthSharedFlow has been deployed
  separately to the org before the proxies so that it is available to support requests from the
  proxies. A shared flow can be developed and managed by a team responsible for broad company
  policies, then consumed in proxies by line-of-business teams building more specialized apps.</p>

  <h3>Developing a shared flow</h3>

  <p>When developing a shared flow, you must always test it with calls sent to an API proxy. In
  other words, you can't send requests directly to a shared flow as you would an API proxy.
  Instead, you send requests to an API proxy which is, in turn, calling out to the shared flow.</p>

  <p>Here are the high-level steps for developing a shared flow:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Figure out what the <b>shared set of features</b> should be.

      <p>For example, you might want to combine traffic management features, including suppressing
      traffic spikes. That way, you can manage their configuration outside the workflow of those
      implementing line-of-business logic.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Develop a shared flow</b> by implementing policies and supporting resources, just as you
      would when developing an API proxy.

      <p>A shared flow is a sequence of conditional steps. So developing one is like developing an
      API proxy. You can include policies and resources you might include in a proxy.</p>

      <p>For example, as part of your traffic management support, you might implement a Spike
      Arrest policy to allow only 30 requests per second, as in the following example:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;SpikeArrest async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Spike-Arrest"&gt;
    &lt;DisplayName&gt;Spike Arrest&lt;/DisplayName&gt;
    &lt;Properties/&gt;
    &lt;Identifier ref="request.header.some-header-name"/&gt;
    &lt;MessageWeight ref="request.header.weight"/&gt;
    &lt;Rate&gt;30ps&lt;/Rate&gt;
&lt;/SpikeArrest&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Then, to a shared flow for traffic management, you could attach the Spike Arrest policy as
      a step. The policy would execute for any API proxy that calls the shared flow.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;SharedFlow name="default"&gt;
    &lt;Step&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;Spike-Arrest&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;/Step&gt;
&lt;/SharedFlow&gt;
</pre>

      <p>For information on how to get a shared flow started in the management console, see
      <a href="#creating-a-shared-flow">Creating a shared flow with the Apigee Edge management
      console</a>.</p>

      <p>As with API proxies, you can import a zip file containing your shared flow source
      artifacts (see <a href="/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/apis-0">Import a new
      API Proxy</a> for more about importing proxies). The following illustrates how to import a
      shared flow with the management API:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/zip/file.zip" \ 'https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/sharedflows?action=import&amp;name=shared-flow-name' \
-u email:password
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Deploy the shared flow</b> to the environment before deploying proxies or shared flows
      that will consume it. You deploy a shared flow in the same way you deploy an API proxy. (For
      more, see <a href="/api-platform/deploy/understanding-deployment.html">Understanding
      deployment</a>.)

      <p>A shared flow must be in the same org and deployed to the same environment as the API
      proxies and other shared flows that consume it. Deploying the shared flow before the proxies
      makes it possible to resolve the proxy's dependency on the shared flow at deploy time.</p>

      <p>You can deploy a shared flow with a management API call such as the following:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/e/{env_name}/sharedflows/{shared_flow_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments \
-u email:password
</pre>

      <p>You can also replace a currently deployed shared flow with no downtime. (This is very like
      API proxies. See <a href=
      "/api-platform/deploy/deploy-api-proxies-using-management-api.html">Deploy API proxies using
      the management API</a> for more). Here's the request form using the management API:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/e/{env_name}/sharedflows/{shared_flow_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments?"override=true" \
-u email:password
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Develop the consuming API proxy</b> so that it can call the shared flow as part of its own
      flow.

      <p>From an API proxy, you call to a shared flow with a <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/flow-callout-policy.html">Flow Callout policy</a>. (You can
      also attach the shared flow to the proxy using a flow hook, as described in <a href=
      "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-hooks.html">Attaching a shared flow using a flow hook</a>.)
      For an introductory tutorial on creating an API proxy, see {{gs_tutorial}}.</p>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> To consume a shared flow, an API proxy must be deployed
      after the shared flow and to the same environment as the shared flow. The shared flow has to
      be in place when you want to test a call to it using the Flow Callout policy.</aside>

      <p>To consume a shared flow, you add a Flow Callout policy to the proxy or shared flow that
      will consume it. Like a Service Callout policy, with which you call out to another service, a
      Flow Callout calls out to the shared flow.</p>

      <p>In the following code, a Flow Callout policy calls out to a shared flow called
      <code>traffic-management-shared</code>.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;FlowCallout async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Traffic-Management-Flow-Callout"&gt;
    &lt;DisplayName&gt;Traffic Management Flow Callout&lt;/DisplayName&gt;
    &lt;Properties/&gt;
    &lt;SharedFlowBundle&gt;traffic-management-shared&lt;/SharedFlowBundle&gt;
&lt;/FlowCallout&gt;
</pre>

      shared flow</a></p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Deploy the consuming API proxy</b> to begin using the shared flow. (For more, see
    <a href="/api-platform/deploy/understanding-deployment.html">Understanding
    deployment</a>.)</li>

    <li>
      <b>Develop iteratively by tracing, as you would with an API proxy.</b>

      <p>As with an API proxy, you develop a shared flow by iteratively invoking and tracing until
      you have the logic the way you want it. In this case, because the shared flow doesn't run on
      its own, you invoke a proxy endpoint and trace the proxy.</p>

      <p>Here are the steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure that both the shared flow and the API proxy calling it with a Flow Callout
        policy are in the same organization and deployed to the same environment.</li>

        <li>On the API proxy's <b>Trace</b> tab, begin tracing the API proxy.</li>

        <li>Send a request to a proxy endpoint in the API proxy. The flow from the endpoint must
        include the Flow Callout policy that calls out to the shared flow.</li>

        <li>On the <b>Trace</b> tab, examine the flow from the API proxy to the shared flow.

          <p>Notice that in tracing, the shared flow is represented as a set of steps or policies
          enclosed in a grey box. Icons representing Flow Callout policies precede shared flows.
          (For more on tracing, see <a href="/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html">Using the
          Trace tool</a>.)</p>

  <h3 id="creating-a-shared-flow">Creating a shared flow with the Apigee Edge management
  console</h3>

  <p>When you use the Apigee Edge UI to create a shared flow, you can either create one from
  scratch or by importing existing flow sources as a flow bundle .zip file.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the management console, select the organization within which you want to create the
    shared flow.

      <p>The shared flow will be available to any API proxies and shared flows deployed to an
      environment from this organization. It won't be available from outside this organization.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click the <b>APIs &gt; Shared Flows</b> menu.

      <p>On the <b>Shared Flows</b> page, you can view a list of shared flows in the organization.
      You can edit or delete flows in the list.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click the <b>+ Shared Flow</b> button to begin adding a new shared flow.</li>

    <li>On the <b>Build a Shared Flow</b> page, choose how you want to created the new flow:

      <ul>
        <li>Create a new flow from scratch. You'll be able to configure policies and resources as
        steps in the flow.

          <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Empty Shared Flow</b>.</li>

            <li>Enter a name value. This will be the name that API proxies and other shared flows
            use to reference this shared flow. The name should be descriptive to developers
            consuming the flow.</li>

            <li>Enter a description to provide more information about what the flow does.</li>

            <li>Click <b>Next</b>.</li>

            <li>Optionally, select the environments to which you want the new flow deployed.

              <p>For example, if you'll be testing the shared flow from API proxies deployed to the
              test environment, then deploy the shared flow to <b>test</b>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Click <b>Build and Deploy</b> to have the new shared flow created and deployed to
              the environment(s) you selected. If you selected no environment, the shared flow will
              be created, but not deployed.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Create a shared flow from existing sources by uploading a flow bundle.

          <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Shared Flow Bundle</b> to specify a .zip file containing the artifacts
            you want in the new flow.

              <p>A shared flow bundle contains the source artifacts of a shared flow. For example,
              if you were to download a shared flow from the management console, you'd have a .zip
              file with the flow bundle.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Click <b>Next</b>.</li>

            <li>Click <b>Choose File</b> to browse for the .zip file containing the shared flow
            sources you want to import.</li>

            <li>In the <b>Shared Flow Name</b> box, enter a name for the imported flow. This will
            be the name that API proxies and other shared flows use to reference this shared flow.
            The name should be descriptive to developers consuming the flow.</li>

            <li>Click <b>Next</b>.</li>

            <li>Click <b>Build</b> to build the new flow from the sources you're importing.</li>
