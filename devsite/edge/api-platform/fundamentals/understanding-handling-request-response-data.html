  <p>When you make a request to an API proxy, you can pass any or all of the following information,
  depending on the way the API proxy is configured:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Request headers</li>
    <li>Query params</li>
    <li>Form data</li>
    <li>XML or JSON payloads</li>
    <li>Resource URIs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By default, all data in a request is passed unchanged from the ProxyEndpoint to the
  TargetEndpoint. Therefore, when the TargetEndpoint makes the request to the backend server, all
  information in the original request is passed to the backend service.</p>

  <p>The same is true for the response received by Edge from the backend service. By default, all
  data received in the response is passed unchanged to the app that originated the
  request.</p>

  <h2 id="howrequestdatapassedtothebackendserver">How is request data passed to the backend
  server?</h2>

  <p>The following image shows an API proxy definition:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/ApigeeProxyRoute_v2.png"></p>

  <p>For this API proxy:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>API proxy virtual host: "default"</li>
    <li>Domain defined by the virtual host: "http://myOrg-prod.apigee.net"</li>
    <li>Proxy base path: "/v1/weather"</li>
    <li>TargetEndpoint specifid by route rule: "default"</li>
    <li>Target URL: "http://weather.yahooapis.com"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A client app makes a <code>GET</code> request to the API proxy by using the following
  <code>curl</code> command:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X GET http://myOrg-prod.apigee.net/v1/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>

  <p>Notice that this request contains the resource "forecastrss" and one query param,
  <code>w</code>. Edge parses the request as
  shown below and assigns parts of the request to flow variables:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{request.verb} {proxy.basepath}/{proxy.pathsuffix}?{request.querystring}
</pre>
  <p>The flow variables are set with the following values:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>request.verb</code>: "GET"</li>
    <li><code>proxy.basepath</code>: "/v1/weather"</li>
    <li><code>proxy.pathsuffix</code>: "forecastrss"</li>
    <li><code>request.querystring</code>: "w=12797282"</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3> There are many different flow variables
  created during the
  processing of a request and response. See {{variables_reference}} for more.</aside>

  <p>The TargetEndpoint then makes a request to the backend service using information from the
  request:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{request.verb} {<strong>target.basepath</strong>}/{proxy.pathsuffix}?{request.querystring}
</pre>

  <p>Notice how the resource and query params specified in the request are automatically included
  in the request to the backend server. From the definition of the TargetEndpoint, the request then
  has the form:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X GET http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>

  <p>Like query params, any headers or form params that you include in the request to the API
  proxy are passed on to the backend server. For example, you make the request below that includes
  a header:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X GET -H 'Content-type:application/xml' http://myOrg-prod.apigee.net/v1/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>

  <p>Or a request in the form below to include a header and form data:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/json" -d \
  '{"email" : "janetutorialxml@example.com",
    "firstName" : "Jane",
    "lastName" : "Tutorial",
    "userName" : "jtutorialxml"
  }' \
  http://myOrg-prod.apigee.net/v1/register/user
</pre>

  <p>In both examples, the headers and form data are passed unchanged to the backend service. The
  headers are represented by flow variables such as <code>request.headers.count</code> and
  <code>request.headers.names</code>. The form data is represented by flow variables such as
  <code>request.formparam.count</code> and <code>request.formparam.names</code>.</p>


  <h2 id="howisresponsedatareturned">How is response data returned?</h2>

  <p>By default, all data received by Edge from the backend service in the response is passed
  unchanged to the app that originated the request. As described above for the request, the data
  returned in the response is accessible through flow variables on Edge. For more information,
  see {{variables_reference}}.</p>

  <h2 id="manipulatingrequestandresponsedatainanapiproxy">Access request and response data in
  an API proxy</h2>

  <p>There are many times where you want to modify request data before sending it to the backend
  server. For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To remove security information used by Edge to validate requests. That information is not
      required by the backend service.</li>
    <li>To add data sent to the backend service, for example to track users or to gather
      analytics.</li>
    <li>To conditionally process the request based on request data. For example, an API proxy can
      have multiple TargetEndpoints. The TargetEndpoint used by the request is determined by request
      data. You then strip that data from the request before sending it to the backend service.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The same is true for data in the response. As part of processing the response, the API proxy
  might want to modify the data before returning it to the requesting app.</p>

  <h3 id="access-request-messages">Access request messages</h3>
  <p>You can use policies to access and change parts of a request message. These parts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Headers</li>
    <li>Query parameters</li>
    <li>Form parameters</li>
    <li>Source IP address</li>
    <li>HTTP message body</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In a normal flow, once the request has been processed, the proxy then sends the transformed
  request to the target.</p>

  <p>Policies can examine request variables, then transform or reject the request based on the
  content of those variables. Policies transform the request by setting the appropriate variables,
  for example variables corresponding to the request headers.</p>

  <aside class="key-point">
    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">TIP</h3>
    You can use variables to reconstruct the incoming request URL. For example, the
    following code in a {{javascript_policy}} assembles the request URL from its parts:

    <pre class="prettyprint">var req_verb = context.getVariable('request.verb');
var req_scheme = context.getVariable('client.scheme');
var req_host = context.getVariable('request.header.host');
var req_request_uri = context.getVariable('request.uri');
var req_url = req_scheme + "://" + req_host + req_request_uri;</pre>

    <p>The result of the concatenation might look like the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">https://myorg-test.apigee.net/foo</pre>
  </aside>

  <h3 id="access-response-messages">Access response messages</h3>
  <p>Using the variables that apply to the response message, policies may access message components
  including the header, the query parameters, and form parameters, the source IP address, the HTTP
  message body, and so on.</p>

  <p>The proxy receives a response message, then applies to it a series of policies, based on
  conditions evaluated on the response, which can modify or transform the response.</p>

  <p>Policies can examine response variables, then transform or reject the request based on the
  content of those variables. Policies transform the response by setting the appropriate variables,
  for example variables corresponding to the response headers.</p>

  <h3>Common policies to access flow variables</h3>

  <p>Edge defines several policies that you can use to process the request and response data. These
  policies include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>{{assign_message_policy}}: Creates or modifies HTTP request or response messages during an API proxy
      flow. Also creates and populates new flow variables.</li>
    <li>{{extract_variables_policy}}: Extract content from messages, including headers, URI paths, payloads, and
      query parameters, for use in a condition statement. The policy then applies a text pattern to
      message content and upon finding a match sets a designated variable.</li>
    <li>{{json_to_xml_policy}} and {{xml_to_json_policy}}:
      Converts messages from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to the extensible markup language
      (XML) format, or vice versa.</li>
    <li>{{java_callout_policy}}, {{javascript_policy}}, {{python_script_policy}},
      {{regex_protection_policy}}: These policies let you write a script to access flow variables
      containing request and response data.</li>
  </ul>
