  <p><em>Flow variables</em> are pre-bound (or <em>pre-defined</em>) variables that, depending on
  context, point to objects. Flow variables let you maintain state associated with an API transaction
  processed by Apigee Edge.</p>

  <p>You use flow variables in policies, conditional flows, utilities such as {{trace}},
  and other areas of Edge. For more information, see
  <a href="#howareflowvariablesused">How flow variables are used</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="whatareflowvariables">What are flow variables?</h2>

  <p>Flow variables exist within the context of an API proxy flow, and they track state in an API
  transaction the way named variables track state in a software program. Flow variables store
  information such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The content of a request or response</li>
    <li>The IP address, headers, and URL path sent from the requesting app</li>
    <li>System information such as the date and time when Edge receives a request</li>
    <li>Data derived when a policy executes. For example, after a policy that validates an
      OAuth token executes, Edge creates flow variables that hold information like the name of the
      requesting application.</li>
    <li>Information about the response from the target system</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some variables are "pre-bound" and are automatically populated whenever an API request
  is received. They are available throughout an API transaction.</p>

  <p>You can also create your own custom variables using policies (such as the
  {{assign_message_policy}}), or in JavaScript, Node.js, or Java code.</p>

  <p>As you'll see, variables have scope, and where they are accessible depends in part on when they
  are created in the API proxy flow. In general, when a variable is created, it is available to
  all policies and code that execute later in the API transaction flow.</p>

  <h2 id="howareflowvariablesused">How are flow variables used?</h2>

  <p>Flow variable are used in <a href=
  "/api-platform/develop/policy-attachment-and-enforcement">policies</a> and <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-variables-and-conditions">conditional flows</a>:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Policies</strong> can retrieve state from flow variables and use them to do their
      work.
      <p>For example, the {{verify_jwt_policy}} can retrieve the token to be verified from
      a flow variable and then perform the verification on it. As another example, a
      {{javascript_policy}} can retrieve flow variables and encode the data contained within
      those variables.</p>
      <p>Many policies create policy-specific flow variables as part of their normal execution. The
      <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/reference-overview-policy">Policy reference</a>
      lists these policy-specific variables. For example, the {{quota_policy}} creates a set of
      variables that contain information about quota counts and limits, expiry time, and so on.</p>
      <p>Some policy variables are useful for debugging. You can use the {{trace}} tool, for
      instance, to see which variables were set at a particular step in the proxy flow.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conditional flows</strong> can reference flow variables to direct the flow of an API
      request through Edge, kind of like the way a switch statement works in programming.
      <p>For example, a policy can check whether a request was a <code>GET</code> or a
      <code>POST</code>. If it's a <code>GET</code>, then Edge can execute one set of conditions;
      for <code>POST</code>, another set of conditions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Overwrite flow variables</h3>

  <p>If you're not careful, you <em>can</em> overwrite flow variables. For example, you can overwrite
  the {{request_object}} flow variable in a {{javascript_policy}} with the following line:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">context.setVariable("request", 42);</pre>

  <p>While this definitely isn't recommended, it <em>is</em> valid. Overwriting top-level flow
  variables like <code>request</code> and {{response_object}} can cause unpredictable results.</p>


  <h2 id="understandingflowvariablescope">Flow variable scope</h2>

  <p>Flow variable <strong>scope</strong> is related to the flow or overall "life cycle" of an API
  proxy call.</p>

  <p>There are a couple of simple rules to know when considering the scope of a flow
  variable and its properties.<br/><strong>All flow variables and their properties are:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Global:</strong> You can access any flow variable from any context, as long as the
      variable has been defined.</li>
    <li><strong>Available in remaining contexts:</strong> <em>Starting with the step in the flow in
      which they were defined</em>, all flow variables and their properties are accessible in all
      the remaining contexts in the API proxy.
      <p>For example, the {{response_object}} flow variable is defined in the TargetEndpoint
      response. As a result, it is available in both the TargetEndpoint response and the
      ProxyEndpoint response. The <code>response</code> flow variable is <em>not</em> available in
      the TargetEndpoint request or the ProxyEndpoint request.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following image shows where in the proxy request each flow variable is populated by
  Edge and becomes available to your conditional statements and policies:</p>


  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/flows/vars-added-to-scope.png"/></p>

  <h3 id="visual-flow">Visualize the flow of an API proxy</h3>

  <p>To understand flow variable scope, it's important to understand or visualize the way messages
  flow through an API proxy:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>An API proxy consists of a series of message processing steps organized as a flow.</li>
    <li>At every step in a proxy flow, the proxy evaluates information available to
      it and decides what to do next.</li>
    <li>Along the way, the proxy may execute <a href=
    "/api-platform/develop/policy-attachment-and-enforcement">policies</a> or perform
    <a href="/api-platform/reference/conditions-reference">conditional branching</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following figure illustrates this sequence of flows. Notice how the flows are composed of
  four main segments: ProxyEndpoint <em>request</em>, TargetEndpoint <em>request</em>,
  TargetEndpoint <em>response</em>, and ProxyEndpoint <em>response</em>.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/proxy_flow_diagram2.png"></p>


  <h3 id="scope-flow">How variable scope is related to proxy flow</h3>

  <p>As soon as you can visualize how messages flow through a proxy, you
  can begin to understand variable scope. By scope, we mean the point in the proxy flow life cycle
  when a variable is first instantiated.</p>

  <p>For example, if you have a policy attached to the
  ProxyEndpoint request segment, that policy will not be able to access any variables that are
  scoped to the TargetEndpoint request segment. The reason for this is that the TargetEndpoint
  request segment of the flow has not executed yet, so the API proxy hasn't had a chance to
  populate variables in that scope.</p>

  <p>The following table lists the complete set of variable scopes and indicates when in the proxy
  flow they become available.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3>After a flow variable is populated within
    its given scope, it remains available through the rest of the proxy flow life cycle. If you try to
    access a variable that is not yet in scope, you will receive an error or a NULL value.
  </aside>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable scope</th>
        <th>Where these variables are populated</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>proxy request</td>
        <td>The ProxyEndpoint request segment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>target request</td>
        <td>The TargetEndpoint request segment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>target response</td>
        <td>The TargetEndpoint response segment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>proxy response</td>
        <td>The ProxyEndpoint response segment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>always available</td>
        <td>As soon as the proxy receives a request. These variables are available through the
        entire proxy flow life cycle.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>For example, the pre-bound variable {{client_object}} has a property called <code>ip</code>.
  This property is automatically populated with the IP address of the client that called the proxy.
  This property has "proxy request" scope: it is populated when a request first hits the
  ProxyEndpoint and remains available through the entire proxy flow life cycle.</p>

  <p>Another pre-bound flow variable, {{target_object}}, has a <code>url</code> property.
  <code>target.url</code> is populated in the TargetEndpoint request segment with the request URL sent
  to the backend target. This property's scope is "target request". If you try to access
  <code>target.url</code> in the ProxyEndpoint request segment, you will receive a NULL value.
  If you try to set this variable before it is in scope, the proxy does nothing; it does not
  generate an error and does not set the variable.</p>

  <aside class="note"><h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3>It's possible to configure some policies,
  such as {{assign_message_policy}}, to either throw an error or return NULL when an undefined
  variable is accessed. Refer to individual policy reference pages for details.</aside>

  <p>Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to think about variable scope. Suppose you want
  to copy the entire contents of a {{request_object}} (headers, parameters, body) and assign it to the
  response payload to be sent back to the calling app. You can use the {{assign_message_policy}} for
  this task. The policy code looks like this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">{% include "api-platform/fundamentals/examples/conditions/simple-assign-message.xml" %}</pre>

  <p>This policy simply copies the {{request_object}} object and assigns it to the
  {{response_object}} object. But where should this policy be placed in the proxy flow? The
  answer is that it must be placed on the TargetEndpoint response, because the scope of the
  response variable is "target response."</p>

  <h2 id="referencingflowvariables">Reference flow variables</h2>

  <p>All pre-bound flow variables in Apigee Edge follow a dot-notation naming convention.</p>

  <p>The exact syntax that you use to reference a flow variable depends on the context. For example,
  within a policy configuration you use curly braces around flow variables and their properties. The
  following table describes how you reference flow variables depending on the context:</p>

    <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Context</th>
        <th>Syntax</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Policy</td>
        <td>
          <strong>Syntax:</strong> Enclosed in curly braces:
          <pre>{client.ip}</pre>
          <hr/>
          <p>The following example {{assign_message_policy}} takes the value of
          <code>client.ip</code> and puts it in a request header called <code>Client-IP</code>:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">{% include "api-platform/fundamentals/examples/conditions/flow-vars-in-policy.xml" %}</pre>
          <p>Some policies take flow variables as input. The following example
          takes the value of the {{client_object}} flow variable's <code>ip</code> property and puts
          it in a request header called <code>My-Client-IP</code>:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">{% include "api-platform/fundamentals/examples/conditions/am-ip.xml" %}</pre>
          <p>If you add the policy to the <em>request</em> flow, it sets a header that is passed to
          the backend target. If you add the policy to the <em>response</em> flow, the header is
          sent back to the client app.</p>
          <p>As another example, when a {{quota_policy}} executes, several flow variables are populated
          with policy-related values. One of these variables is called
          <code>ratelimit.<var>policy_name</var>.used.count</code> (where <var>policy_name</var> is
          the value of the policy's <code>name</code> attribute) in its configuration file.</p>
          <p>You might later execute a conditional flow
          that says "if the current quota count is below 50% of maximum, and it's between 9 am and 5 pm,
          enforce a different quota." This condition might depend on the value of the current quota count
          and on the {{system_object}} flow variable, which is one of the pre-bound Edge variables.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Conditional&nbsp;flow</td>
        <td>
          <strong>Syntax:</strong> Curly braces are not necessary:
          <pre>client.ip</pre>
          <hr/>
          The following example evaluates <code>request.header.accept</code> in a
          conditional flow:
          <pre class="prettyprint">{% include "api-platform/fundamentals/examples/conditions/flow-step.xml" %}</pre>
          <p><a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-variables-and-conditions">Conditional flows</a>
          evaluate flow variables and enable proxies to behave dynamically based on the values of those
          variables. Conditions are typically used to change the behavior of flows, steps, and route
          rules.</p>
          <p>Here's a conditional flow that evaluates
          the value of the {{request_object}} variable's <code>verb</code> property in a proxy flow step:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">{% include "api-platform/fundamentals/examples/conditions/conditional-verb.xml" %}</pre>
          <p>In this example, if the request verb is "POST", the {{verify_api_key_policy}}
          executes. This is a common pattern used in API proxy configurations.</p>

        <td>
          <strong>Syntax:</strong> Usually wrapped in quotes within a getter/setter:

          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">context.setVariable("request.verb", "GET");</pre>
          <p>With the {{javascript_policy}}, you can execute JavaScript code from within the context of an
          API proxy flow. JavaScript executed by this policy uses the Apigee {{javascript_object_model}},
          which provides your custom code access to the following objects in the API proxy flow in which
          your code is executing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>{{request_object}}</li>
            <li>{{response_object}}</li>
            <li><code>context</code> object (part of Edge's {{jom}}</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following example sets a response header with the value obtained from
          <code>target.name</code>:</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">context.setVariable("response.header.X-Apigee-Target",
  context.getVariable("<strong>target.name</strong>"));</pre>
          <p>This technique of using JavaScript to read and set variables is similar to the work you
          can do with the {{assign_message_policy}}. It's just another way to accomplish the same
          kinds of things on Edge. The key to remember is that JavaScript executed by the
          {{javascript_policy}} has access to <em>all</em> the flow variables and are
          <a href="#understandingflowvariablescope">in scope</a> within the API proxy flow.</p>

          <p>You can get, set, and delete flow variables from Node.js code deployed to Edge. All you
          need to do is "require" the <code>apigee-access</code> module in your code. For details,
          see <a href="/api-platform/nodejs/access-flow-variables-nodejs">Accessing flow variables
          in Node.js</a>.
          <p>The following simple example sets <code>custom.foo</code> to "Bar". Once set, the
          <code>custom</code> variable's <code>foo</code> property becomes available to any policies
          or other code that occurs in the proxy flow after the Node.js code executes.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">var http = require('http');
var apigee = require('apigee-access');

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  apigee.setVariable(request, "custom.foo", "Bar");

  </table>

  <h3 id="variablesInJavascript">Use flow variables in JavaScript</h3>

  <p>You can access and set variables directly in JavaScript code that is executing in the context
  of an API proxy. You do this from the {{javascript_policy}}. Through the Apigee
  {{javascript_object_model}}, JavaScript executing on Edge has direct access to flow variables.</p>

  <p>To access variables in JavaScript code, call getter/setter methods on any of these objects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>context</code></li>
    <li><code>proxyRequest</code></li>
    <li><code>proxyResponse</code></li>
    <li><code>targetRequest</code></li>
    <li><code>targetResponse</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>As you can see, these object references map to the familiar segments of the proxy flow model
  as explained previously in <a href="#visual-flow">Visualizing the flow of an API proxy</a>.</p>

  <p>The <code>context</code> object corresponds to "globally" available variables, such as system
  variables. For example, you can call <code>getVariable()</code> on the <code>context</code> object
  to get the current year:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">var year = context.getVariable("system.time.year");</pre>

  <p>Similarly, you can call <code>setVariable()</code> to set the value of a custom variable or for
  any <em>writable</em> flow variable.</p>

  <p>The following example creates a custom variable called <code>organization.name.myorg</code>
  and assigns a value to it:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">var org = context.setVariable('organization.name.myorg', value);</pre>

  <p>Because this variable is created with the <code>context</code> object, it will be available to
  all flow segments (essentially, this is like creating a global variable).</p>

  <aside class="note"><h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3> The {{variables_reference}} indicates which
  variables are writable and which are read-only. For information about the JavaScript Object Model,
  see {{jom}}.</aside>

  <h2 id="datatypeofflowvariables">Data types of flow variables</h2>

  <p>Flow variables are typically complex data types (objects). Each property of a flow variable
  has a well-defined data type, such as String, Long, Integer, Boolean, or Collection. You can find
  the data types listed in the {{variables_reference}}. For variables that were created by a policy,
  refer to the specific policy reference topic for data type information.</p>

  <p>Custom flow variables assume the type given when they were created, and depend
  on the types of values that are allowed. For example, variables created in Node.js code are
  restricted to Number, String, Boolean, null, or undefined.</p>

  <h2 id="custom">Create custom flow variables</h2>

  <p>The {{extract_variables_policy}} lets you create custom flow variables and populate them with
  data extracted from messages. You can extract all the same data that the pre-bound flow
  variables can, such as query parameters, headers, and other data. For example, you can parse
  request and response messages using patterns to extract specific data from the messages.</p>

  <p>In the following example, the Extract Variables policy parses a response message and stores
  specific data taken from the response:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">{% include "api-platform/fundamentals/examples/conditions/em-custom.xml" %}</pre>

  <p>In this example, the policy creates a custom flow variable,
  <code>geocoderesponse</code>, with two properties, <code>latitude</code> and
  <code>longitude</code>. The policy assigns values to these properties.

  <p>Again, be aware that many policies have their own policy-specific properties. You can access
  those properties within the proxy flow context, and they are documented in the policy reference
  under each individual policy topic.</p>

  <p>When you create custom flow variables, be sure to use the following guidelines:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do not use an existing flow variable name for your custom variable. The results can be
      unpredictable. Apigee reserves the following names for the pre-bound flow variables:
      {% include "includes/flow-variables/_all.html" %}
    </li>
    <li>Apigee recommends that you use dot-notation when you create and use custom flow variables.
      It can be useful to use the periods to organize a hierarchy of your custom variables.
      <p>For example, <code>approval.code</code> and <code>approval.status</code> both might refer to
      an approval feature within the flow.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id="whatyouneedtoremember">What you need to remember</h2>

  <p>Here are a few important things to remember about flow variables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some variables are "pre-bound": Edge instantiates and populates them automatically. These
      are documented in the {{variables_reference}}.</li>
    <li>Flow variables and properties have scope. For example, some variables are automatically
      populated when the first proxy receives a request from an app. Other variables are populated
      in the response flow segment of the proxy. These response variables remain undefined until the
      response segment executes.</li>
    <li>When policies execute, they can create and populate policy-specific variables. The
      documentation for each policy lists all of these relevant policy-specific variables.</li>
    <li>Conditional flows typically evaluate one or more variables. You must understand
      variables if you want to create conditional flows.</li>
    <li>Many policies use variables as input or output. For example, one policy might create a
      custom variable and another policy might use its value.</li>
    <li>You can get and set many flow variables from within Node.js by using straight JavaScript
      (and our {{javascript_object_model}}) or the {{java_callout_policy}}, which executes code
      on Edge).</li>
    <li>You can create custom variables that are available for use in the proxy flow. It's possible
      to create variables using policies like {{assign_message_policy}} and {{javascript_policy}},
      as well as in Node.js code.</li>
    <li>When you create a custom flow variable, use a unique value for its name; do not use the
      names of the pre-bound variables.</li>
  </ul>
