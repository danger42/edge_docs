  <p>This topic describes the structure of policy errors and the kinds of flow variables that are
  set when a policy error occurs. This information is essential if you're designing and
  implementing fault handling for your proxies.</p>

  <p>This topic assumes you have a general understanding of how fault handling works in Edge, and
  that you know what fault rules are. If you need a review, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/fault-handling.html">Handling faults</a>. The information here will
  also help you navigate and use the <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/error-code-reference.html">Policy error reference</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="aboutthedefaultpolicyerrorresponse">About the default policy error response</h2>

  <p>When a policy throws an error, Edge immediately enters the error flow and generates an error
  message. This system-generated message is a JSON object that includes two bits of information: an
  <strong>errorcode</strong> and a <strong>faultstring</strong>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> It's helpful to know that in the parts of an error as shown
  below are available as flow variables. You can restructure and customize error messages through
  these variables. The variable <strong>fault.name</strong> is the value of the
  <strong>errorcode</strong> attribute and <strong>error.message</strong> is the value of the
  <strong>faultstring</strong> attribute. These variables are discussed in more detail in the
  following sections of this topic.  </aside>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{  
   "fault":{  
      "detail":{  
         "errorcode":"steps.extractvariables.SourceMessageNotAvailable"
      },
      "faultstring":"foo message is not available for ExtractVariable: ParseJsonResponse"
   }
}
</pre>

  <p>Let's quickly deconstruct this error message:</p>

  <p>The <strong>errorcode</strong> consists of a <strong>prefix</strong> and an <strong>error
  name</strong>, as follows: <code>[prefix].[error_name]</code>. In the above example
  "<code>steps.extractvariables</code>" is the prefix and <code>SourceMessageNotAvailable</code> is
  the error name. The prefix tells you what kind of policy generated the error. In the above
  example, you can tell that an Extract Variables policy generated the error and the error name is
  <code>SourceMessageNotAvailable</code>.</p>

  <p>The <strong>faultstring</strong> contains a description of the error. The fault string
  typically includes clues to help you find specific problem that caused the error, such as the
  name of the policy, the name of an unresolved variable, or whatever contributed to the error. For
  example, in the above error message, "<code>foo</code>" happens to be the name of an unresolved
  message variable referenced in the policy and "<code>ParseJsonResponse</code>" is the name of the
  policy that triggered the error.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In the <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/error-code-reference.html">Policy error reference</a>, we use a
  consistent convention to document policy fault strings. We indicate where place variables occur
  with a  <code>[]</code> notation. Here's an example of how we'd document the above error's
  fault string:<br>
  <br>
  <code>[var_name] message is not available for ExtractVariable: [policy_name]</code>.</aside>

  <h2 id="variablesspecifictopolicyerrors">Variables specific to policy errors</h2>

  <p>When a policy error is triggered, certain error-specific flow variables are populated. These
  variables are extremely useful in fault handling. As explained in the topic <a href=
  "/api-platform/fundamentals/fault-handling.html">Handling faults</a>, it's a common practice to
  trap the system-generated policy errors and perform a subsequent action such as to create a
  custom error response. For example, for security reasons, you might want to prevent clients from
  seeing the actual errors and status codes that Edge returns.</p>

  <h3 id="variablesspecifictopolicyerrors-thefaultnamevariable"><strong>The <code>fault.name</code>
  variable</strong></h3>

  <p>When a policy throws an error, it sets the flow variable <code>fault.name</code> to the
  <code>error_name</code> part of the errorcode (as described in the previous section). It's very
  common to evaluate this variable to conditionally execute fault rules. </p>

  <p>Here's an example fault rule that tests for the value of <code>fault.name</code>:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;faultrule name="VariableOfNonMsgType"&lt;&gt;/faultrule&gt;&lt;FaultRule name="Source Message Not Available Fault"&gt;
    &lt;Step&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;AM-CustomErrorMessage&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Condition&gt;(fault.name Matches "SourceMessageNotAvailable") &lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;/Step&gt;
&lt;/FaultRule&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The thing to remember is that when a policy triggers an error, the <code>fault.name</code>
  variable is always set to the error name.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> When you're developing your fault handling code, just look in
  the <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/error-code-reference.html">Policy error
  reference</a> to learn what the error name is for every policy error. It's also a common practice
  to use the Edge Trace tool to examine error responses and the variables that are set.</aside>

  <h3 id="variablesspecifictopolicyerrors-theprefixpolicy_namefailedvariable"><strong>The
  <code>[prefix].[policy_name].failed</code> variable</strong></h3>

  <p>Besides <code>fault.name</code>, another variable that developers commonly check is the
  <code>[prefix].[policy_name].failed</code> flag, which is set to either true or false when a
  policy executes. In fault rules, you'll want to check to see when it's <strong>true</strong> --
  that is, to check if an error occurred. Here's how to construct a conditional that checks the
  <code>[prefix].[policy_name].failed</code> flag. To correctly check this variable, you need to
  know two things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>name</strong> of the policy you are checking. This is the value of the policy's
    name attribute, not the display name. This attribute is always included in the policy
    definition's XML.</li>

    <li>A <strong>prefix</strong> that is specific to the type of policy you are checking. (We'll
    explain how to find the prefix below.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To illustrate, here's another fault rule example. Notice in the outer condition how the
  <code>[prefix].[policy_name].failed</code> variable name is formed. In this case the prefix is
  <code>extractvariables</code> and the policy name is <code>ParseJsonResponse</code>. In this
  case, the fault rule will only execute if this variable is true. And, here's a tip: because fault
  rules can contain multiple steps, this pattern is a nice way to organize fault rules into
  blocks.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;faultrule name="VariableOfNonMsgType"&gt;&lt;/faultrule&gt;&lt;FaultRule name="Extract Variable Faults"&gt;
    &lt;Step&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;AM-CustomErrorMessage&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Condition&gt;(fault.name Matches "SourceMessageNotAvailable") &lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;(extractvariables.ParseJsonResponse.failed = true) &lt;/Condition&gt;
&lt;/FaultRule&gt;
</pre>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> How do you know what the fault variable's prefix is? You can't
  necessarily guess it from the contents of the fault string or error code. You have to look it up
  in the <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/error-code-reference.html">Policy error
  reference</a> or you can use the Edge Trace tool to inspect the flow variables that are created
  when an error occurs. For example, for the Extract Variables policy, the
  <code>[prefix].[policy_name].failed</code> prefix is <code>extractvariables</code>, and that's
  pretty straightforward. But for the Access Control policy, the prefix is <code>acl</code>. So,
  the point is, you have to check.</aside>

  <h3 id="variablesspecifictopolicyerrors-abouttheerrorandmessagevariables"><strong>About the
  <code>error</code> and <code>message</code> variables</strong></h3>

  <p>The <strong><code>error</code></strong> variable is only available in the error flow of a
  proxy. You can get useful information from the error variable, such as the error message, status
  code, reason phrase, and so on. The formatting pattern for the error variable is:</p>

  <p><code>error.[error_component] = [value]</code></p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <p><code>error.message</code> = <code>"request message is not available for ExtractVariable:
  ParseJsonResponse</code>"</p>

  <p>and<br>
  <br>
  <code>error.status.code = "500"</code></p>

  

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> You can also use this variable to set response headers. This
  can be extremely useful because in the error flow, the response object is not available.
   </aside>

  <p>The <code>message</code> variable is also available in the error flow and can be used for
  similar purposes as the <code>error</code> variable. The message variable is special because it
  is contextual. In a request flow, it behaves like a request variable, and in a response flow, it
  can be used to get/set response values. If you want to know more, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/variables-reference.html#messagevariables-usesformessagevariables">Use
  cases for message variables</a>.</p>

  for information on all of the Edge variables, including <code>error</code> and
  <code>message</code>.</p>{% endblock %}
