  <p>As a service provider, you develop APIs for consumption by client apps. You can use two
  different development methods to create, configure, and maintain API proxies and API
  products:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make HTTP requests to the Apigee RESTful APIs to access Edge services.</li>

    <li>Use the Edge management UI at <a href=
    "https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To get started with either method, you first must create a free account at <a href=
  "https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up">https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up</a>.
  See <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/developing-apigee-edge.html">Developing with Apigee
  Edge</a> for more.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Client app developers access your services by making HTTP
  requests to your API proxies. There are no requirements on the type of client app, other than
  making a properly formatted HTTP request and handling data returned by the response. If client
  app developers want to take advantage of the app-building features included with Edge API
  Services, their apps can make HTTP requests directly to those services.</aside>

  <h2 id="usingthemanagementui">Using the management UI</h2>

  <p>The Edge management UI is a browser-based tool you can use to create, configure, and manage
  API proxies and API products. There are a few tasks that require you to use the management API,
  though.</p>

  <p>For an introductory tutorial using the management UI, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/tutorials/add-and-configure-your-first-api.html">Create your first API
  proxy</a>.</p>

  <p>In the Edge management UI, you can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create API proxies by editing code and tracing flow of requests through your proxies.</li>

    <li>Create API products that bundle proxies for exposure to client requests.</li>

    <li>Manage developers and developer apps.</li>

    <li>Configure your test and production environments.</li>

    <li>Implement JavaScript and Node.js applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following image shows the Edge management UI that you can use to create and configure an
  API proxy:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/new_edge_editor.png"></p>

  <h2 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi">Using the RESTful management API</h2>

  <p>You can use Apigee Edge RESTful management APIs to create, configure, and manage API proxies
  and API products, policies for logic in your API proxies, apps and app developers, caches. The
  management API also provides access to low-level capabilities that are not exposed by the
  management UI for reasons of usability.</p>

  <p>These API endpoints often take data containing configuration information and require you to
  pass authentication information, such as username and password, to access them. Following RESTful
  principles, you can call HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods on any of the API resources.</p>

  <p>The following example uses cURL to execute an HTTP POST request to create an API product with
  <a href="/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/apiproducts">Create API Product</a>:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST -d
'{
  "approvalType": "auto",
  "displayName": "Free API Product",
  "name": "weather_free",
  "proxies": [ "weatherapi" ],
  "environments": [ "test" ]
}'
https://enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/my_org/apiproducts -u email:password
</pre>

  <p>For a complete list of resources and methods, see the <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/apis/api-reference-getting-started.html">API reference.</a></p>

  <p>As in other <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> APIs, the Edge
  management API exposes capabilities as API resources. Each resource defines a set of methods that
  act on it.</p>

  <p>Following RESTful principles, you can call HTTP <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
  <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> methods on any of the API resources.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>GET</strong>: Retrieves a list of resources, or the profile of a specific
    resource.</li>

    <li><strong>POST</strong>: Creates a resource, or passed in a parameter, performed an action on
    resource. For example, when you revoke OAuth access tokens, you use the POST method along with
    the parameter <code>action=revoke</code>.</li>

    <li><strong>PUT</strong>: Updates an existing resource.</li>

    <li><strong>DELETE</strong>: Deletes an existing resource.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-understandingthebasepath">Understanding the base path</h3>

  <p>The path you'll use in management API requests concatenates the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>base path</strong> that includes your organization name. (You can locate your
    organization name under <b>User Settings</b> in the <a href=
    "https://enterprise.apigee.com">Edge management UI</a>.)</li>

    <li>An <strong>endpoint</strong> that points to the Edge resource you're accessing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, if your organization name is "apibuilders", then every call you make to the
  management API will use the following base path:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders
</pre>

  <p>To retrieve a list of API proxies in your organization, you would call GET on:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders/apis
</pre>

  <p>Many resources are scoped by environment. Two environments are provided by default: test and
  prod. For example, caches are scoped by environment. A shared cache called "mycache" is included
  by default in every environment.</p>

  <p>You can list caches by calling GET on the cache resource as follows:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders/environments/test/caches
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders/environments/prod/caches
</pre>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-passingcredentials">Passing credentials</h3>

  <p>The API enforces HTTP Basic Authentication. You always need to pass in your username and
  password for your account. These can be passed in as a Base64 encoded header, or as parameters
  (as demonstrated below) in an HTTP client. The following is an example of an HTTP Basic
  Authentication header:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
</pre>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-runningcurlcommands">Running cURL commands</h3>

  <p>Use an HTTP client to make requests to the management API. Many examples in the documentation
  provide sample API requests using cURL, a widely-used HTTP client. If you need to install cURL,
  you can download it from <a href="https://curl.haxx.se">http://curl.haxx.se</a>.</p>

  <p>If you cut and paste a cURL command from the doc to your terminal, you must replace the
  following variables in the command with information for your Apigee account:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>email</code>: The email for your Apigee account</li>

    <li><code>password</code>: The password for your Apigee account</li>

    <li><code>myorg</code>: The name of your Apigee organization</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> On Windows, make sure to download a version of cURL that includes the libcurl
    library. Also on Windows, you might need to use a flag to disable the trust check that cURL
    performs against the TLS/SSL certificate presented by the API Platform. You can do this by
    adding <code>-k</code> to each request you submit via cURL on the command line. This only
    disables the trust check and does not disable encryption. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -k https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}/apis -u email:password
</pre>
  </aside>

  <p>If you are using the Edge samples, set the values for your organization, username, and
  password in the file <code>/setup/setenv.sh</code>. Once you have done so, you can run the
  simplified deploy and invoke scripts provided for each sample API proxy. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using the sample API proxies</a> for more
  information.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Calls to the management API support gzip compression on
  responses. If you set <code>'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate'</code> in your API calls, any
  response greater than 1024 bytes gets returned in gzip format.</aside>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-examplemakingrequestsofthemanagementapi">Example: Making
  requests of the management API</h3>

  <p>In this example, you make an API call to Edge. The API call in this example returns a list of
  the names of all API proxies in your organization. Copy and paste the following command into the
  terminal window on your computer.</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}/apis -u email:password
</pre>

  <p>For brevity, you can abbreviate <code>/organizations</code> as <code>/o</code>. For example,
  if your username is <code>me@mycompany.com</code>, your password is <code>secret</code>, and your
  account in the organization called <code>apifactory</code>, then the request looks like this:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/apifactory/apis -u me@mycompany.com:secret
</pre>

  <p>The response should should contain a JSON array with two API proxies, which are created by
  default for all new users:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
[ "oauth", "weatherapi" ]
</pre>

  <p>cURL has a few tools that can make you life easier. For example, you often need to see the
  HTTP headers associated with a request. To obtain this detail about an HTTP request, you can use
  the <code>-v</code> flag provided by curl. For example:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -u email:password -v
</pre>

  <p>If you only want to see the HTTP headers on the response from the API Platform (and not the
  content), then you can use the <code>-I</code> flag.</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -u email:password -I
</pre>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-examplereturningxml">Example: Returning XML</h3>

  <p>JSON is the default format for response messages. If you require XML, you can add an HTTP
  <code>Accept</code> header to get an XML response instead of JSON:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Accept:text/xml" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apifactory/apis -u me@mycompany.com:secret
</pre>

  <p>When POSTing or PUTting payloads in XML, use the <code>Content-type</code> HTTP header:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Content-type:text/xml" -X POST -d \
'&lt;XMLPayload&gt;
 &lt;/XMLPayload&gt; ' \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apifactory/apis \
-u me@mycompany.com:secret
</pre>

  <h2 id="deploymentenvironments">Deployment environments</h2>

  <p>Every organization using Apigee Edge by default has at least two environments they can use to
  develop, test, and deploy APIs: <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">test</span> and <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">prod</span>.  Use the <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">test</span> environment to develop and test your
  APIs before making them publicly available. Only your internal developers can access APIs
  deployed to the test environment. Deploy your APIs to the <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">prod</span> environment to make them publicly
  available to app developers.</p>

  <h2 id="debuggingandtesting">Debugging and testing</h2>

  <p>Edge API Services provides a trace tool that lets you debug end-to-end request and response
  flows. The trace results display request and response headers and payloads, policy execution,
  variable values, and any errors that may have occurred during the flow.</p>

  <p>Key data points for use in troubleshooting:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Timestamps</strong>: Use timestamps to see how long each step takes to execute.
    Comparing timestamps helps you isolate the policies that are taking the longest to execute that
    are slowing down your API calls.</li>

    <li><strong>Base path</strong>: By verifying the base path, you can ensure that a policy is
    routing the message to correct server.</li>

    <li><strong>Results of policy execution</strong>: These results let you see if the message is
    being altered as expected, such as if the message is being transformed from XML to JSON, or if
    the message is being cached.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following figure shows trace results:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/new_trace.png"></p>

  <p>Each Trace session is broken down into the following major steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Original request received from client</strong>: Displays the verb and URI path of
    the request from the client app, headers, body data, and query parameters.</li>

    <li><strong>Request sent to your backend service</strong>: Displays the request message sent to
    the backend service by the API proxy.</li>

    <li><strong>Response returned by the backend service</strong>: Displays the response headers
    and payload returned by the backend service.</li>

    <li><strong>Final response sent to client:</strong> The response message returned to the
    requesting client app once the response flow has executed.</li>
  </ul>{% endblock %}
