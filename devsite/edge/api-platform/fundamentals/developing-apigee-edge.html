  <p>As a service provider, you develop APIs for consumption by client apps. You can use two
  different development methods to create, configure, and maintain API proxies and API
  products:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make HTTP requests to the Apigee RESTful APIs to access Edge services.</li>
    <li>Use the Edge management UI at <a href=
      "https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To get started with either method, you first must create a free account at <a href=
  "https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up">https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3>
    <p>Client app developers access your services by making HTTP
    requests to your API proxies. There are no requirements on the type of client app, other than
    making a properly formatted HTTP request and handling data returned by the response.</p>
    <p>If client app developers want to take advantage of the app-building features included with
    Edge API Services, their apps can make HTTP requests directly to those services.</p>
  </aside>

  <h2 id="usingthemanagementui">Using the management UI</h2>

  <p>The Edge management UI is a browser-based tool you can use to create, configure, and manage
  API proxies and API products. There are a few tasks that require you to use the management API,
  though.</p>

  <p>For an introductory tutorial using the management UI, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/get-started/get-started">Build your first API proxy</a>.</p>

  <p>In the Edge management UI, you can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create API proxies by editing code and tracing flow of requests through your proxies.</li>
    <li>Create API products that bundle proxies for exposure to client requests.</li>
    <li>Manage developers and developer apps.</li>
    <li>Configure your test and production environments.</li>
    <li>Implement JavaScript and Node.js applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following image shows the Edge management UI that you can use to create and configure an
  API proxy:</p>

  <p><img class="screenshot" width="80%" src="/api-platform/images/new_edge_editor.png"></p>

  <h2 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi">Using the RESTful management API</h2>

  <p>You can use Apigee Edge RESTful management APIs to create, configure, and manage API proxies
  and API products, policies for logic in your API proxies, apps and app developers, caches. The
  management API also provides access to low-level capabilities that are not exposed by the
  management UI for reasons of usability.</p>

  <p>These API endpoints often take data containing configuration information and require you to
  pass authentication information, such as username and password, to access them. Following RESTful
  principles, you can call HTTP <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and
  <code>DELETE</code> methods on any of the API resources.</p>

  <p>As in other <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" class="external">RESTful</a> APIs,
  the Edge management API exposes capabilities as API resources. Each resource defines a set of
  methods that act on it.</p>

  <p>Following RESTful principles, you can call HTTP <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
  <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> methods on any of the API resources.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>GET</strong>: Retrieves a list of resources, or the profile of a specific
      resource.</li>
    <li><strong>POST</strong>: Creates a resource, or passed in a parameter, performed an action on
      resource. For example, when you revoke OAuth access tokens, you use the POST method along with
      the parameter <code>action=revoke</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>PUT</strong>: Updates an existing resource.</li>
    <li><strong>DELETE</strong>: Deletes an existing resource.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For a complete list of resources and their supported methods, see the {{apiref}}.</p>

  <h3>Authenticating access</h3>

  <p>You must authenticate yourself to the management API server when you call the APIs. You can do
  this in one of the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/api-platform/system-administration/using-oauth2">OAuth2</a></li>
    <li><a href="/api-platform/system-administration/enabling-saml-authentication-edge">SAML</a></li>
    <li><a href="/api-platform/system-administration/basic-auth">Basic Auth</a> (not recommended)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition, Apigee recommends that you use two-factor authentication, as described in
  <a href="/api-platform/system-administration/enable-two-factor-auth-your-apigee-account">Enable
  two-factor auth for your Apigee account</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-understandingthebasepath">Understanding the base path</h3>

  <p>The path you'll use in management API requests concatenates the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>base path</strong> that includes your organization name. (You can locate your
      organization name under <b>User Settings</b> in the <a href=
      "https://enterprise.apigee.com">Edge management UI</a>.)</li>
    <li>An <strong>endpoint</strong> that points to the Edge resource you're accessing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, if your organization name is "apibuilders", then every call you make to the
  management API will use the following base path:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders</pre>

  <p>To retrieve a list of API proxies in your organization, you would call GET on:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders/apis</pre>

  <p>Many resources are scoped by environment. Two environments are provided by default: test and
  prod. For example, caches are scoped by environment. A shared cache called "mycache" is included
  by default in every environment.</p>

  <p>You can list caches by calling GET on the cache resource as follows:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders/environments/test/caches
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apibuilders/environments/prod/caches</pre>

  <h3 id="short">Abbreviating Request URLs</h3>
  <p>When you build your request URL to the management API, you can use the following
  abbreviations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>/e = /environments</code></li>
    <li><code>/o = /organizations</code></li>
    <li><code>/r = /revisions</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
<strong>THIS:</strong>
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1<strong>/organizations</strong>/ahamilton-eval<strong>/environments</strong>/prod/apis/helloworld<strong>/revisions</strong>/1/deployments
<strong>CAN BE MUCH SHORTER:</strong>
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1<strong>/o</strong>/ahamilton-eval<strong>/e</strong>/prod/apis/helloworld<strong>/r</strong>/1/deployments</pre>

  <h3 id="usingtherestfulmanagementapi-runningcurlcommands">Executing curl commands</h3>

  <p>Use an HTTP client to make requests to the management API. Many examples in the documentation
  provide sample API requests using <code>curl</code>, a widely-used HTTP client. If you need to
  install <code>curl</code>, you can download it from
  <a href="https://curl.haxx.se" class="external">http://curl.haxx.se</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><h3 class="hide-from-toc">NOTE</h3>
    <p>On Windows, download a version of <code>code</code> that includes the "libcurl"
    library.</p>
    <p>Also on Windows, you might need to use a flag to disable the trust check that <code>curl</code>
    performs against the TLS/SSL certificate presented by the API Platform. You can do this by
    adding <code>-k</code> to each request you submit on the command line. This only disables the
    trust check and does not disable encryption. For example:</p>
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -k https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}/apis -u <var>email_address</var></pre>
  </aside>

  <p>If you are using the Edge samples, set the values for your organization, username, and
  password in the file <code>/setup/setenv.sh</code>. Once you have done so, you can run the
  simplified deploy and invoke scripts provided for each sample API proxy. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/samples/using-samples">Using the sample API proxies</a> for more
  information.</p>

  <p>Calls to the management API support gzip compression on
  responses. If you set <code>'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate'</code> in your API calls, any
  response greater than 1024 bytes gets returned in gzip format.</p>

  <h3 id="formatting">Formatting XML and JSON requests and responses</h3>
  <p>JSON is the default format for response messages. If you require XML, you can add an HTTP
  <code>Accept</code> header to get an XML response instead of JSON:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -H "Accept:text/xml" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apifactory/apis -u <var>email_address</var></pre>

  <p>Use a JSON prettifier such as the json.tool Python library to make your output look better in
  a terminal. For example:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl https://ahamilton-eval-test.apigee.net/getstarted -u <var>email_address</var> | python -m json.tool</pre>
  <p>For XML, you can use <code>xmllint</code>:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl https://ahamilton-eval-test.apigee.net/getstarted -u <var>email_address</var> | xmllint --format -</pre>

  <p>When POSTing or PUTting payloads in XML, use the <code>Content-type</code> HTTP header:</p>
  <pre class="devsite-terminal">acurl -H "Content-type:text/xml" -X POST -d \
'&lt;XMLPayload&gt;
 &lt;/XMLPayload&gt; ' \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apifactory/apis -u <var>email_address</var></pre>

  <h2 id="deploymentenvironments">Deployment environments</h2>

  <p>Every organization using Apigee Edge by default has at least two environments they can use to
  develop, test, and deploy APIs: "test" and "prod". Use the "test" environment to develop and test
  your APIs before making them publicly available. Only your internal developers can access APIs
  deployed to the test environment. Deploy your APIs to the "prod" environment to make them publicly
  available to app developers.</p>

  <h2 id="debuggingandtesting">Debugging and testing</h2>

  <p>Edge API Services provides a trace tool that lets you debug end-to-end request and response
  flows. The trace results display request and response headers and payloads, policy execution,
  variable values, and any errors that may have occurred during the flow.</p>

  <p>Key data points for use in troubleshooting:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Timestamps</strong>: Use timestamps to see how long each step takes to execute.
      Comparing timestamps helps you isolate the policies that are taking the longest to execute that
      are slowing down your API calls.</li>
    <li><strong>Base path</strong>: By verifying the base path, you can ensure that a policy is
      routing the message to correct server.</li>
    <li><strong>Results of policy execution</strong>: These results let you see if the message is
      being altered as expected, such as if the message is being transformed from XML to JSON, or if
      the message is being cached.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following figure shows trace results:</p>

  <p><img class="screenshot" width="80%" src="/api-platform/images/new_trace.png"></p>

  <p>Each Trace session is broken down into the following major steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Original request received from client</strong>: Displays the verb and URI path of
      the request from the client app, headers, body data, and query parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Request sent to your backend service</strong>: Displays the request message sent to
      the backend service by the API proxy.</li>
    <li><strong>Response returned by the backend service</strong>: Displays the response headers
      and payload returned by the backend service.</li>
    <li><strong>Final response sent to client:</strong> The response message returned to the
      requesting client app once the response flow has executed.</li>
  </ul>
