{% block body %}

<p>Edge lets you invoke one API Proxy from another API Proxy. This feature is useful especially if
you have an API Proxy that contains reusable code that can be used by other API Proxies.</p>

<h2>Antipattern</h2>

<p>Invoking one API Proxy from another either using HTTPTargetConnection in the target endpoint or
custom JavaScript code results in additional network hop.</p>

<h3>Invoke Proxy 2 from Proxy 1 using HTTPTargetConnection</h3>
<p>The following code sample invokes Proxy 2 from Proxy 1 using HTTPTargetConnection:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-1.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>

<h3>Invoke Proxy 2 from Proxy 1 from the JavaScript code</h3>

<p>The next code sample invokes Proxy 2 from Proxy 1 using JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-2.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>

<h3>Code Flow</h3>

<p>To understand why this has an inherent disadvantage, we need to understand the route a request
takes as illustrated by the diagram below:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/api-platform/images/antipatterns/proxies-requests.png"/>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Code Flow</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As depicted in the diagram, a request traverses multiple distributed components, including the
Router and the Message Processor.</p>

<p>In the code samples above, invoking Proxy 2 from Proxy 1 means that the request has to be routed
through the traditional route (i.e Router &gt; MP) at runtime. This would be akin to invoking an API
from a client thereby making multiple network hops that add to the latency. These hops are
unnecessary considering that Proxy 1 request has already "reached" the MP.</p>


<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>Invoking one API Proxy from another API Proxy incurs unnecessary network hops, that is the
request has to be passed on from one Message Processor to another Message Processor.</p>

<h2>Best practice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use the <a href="/api-services/content/connecting-proxies-other-proxies">proxy chaining</a>
    feature for invoking one API Proxy from another. Proxy chaining is more
    efficient as it uses local connection to reference the target endpoint (another API Proxy).
    <p>The code sample shows proxy chaining using LocalTargetConnection in your endpoint
    definition:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-3.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
    <p>The invoked API Proxy gets executed within the same Message Processor; as a result, it avoids
    the network hop as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/api-platform/images/antipatterns/proxy-chaining.png"/>

  </li>
</ul>
