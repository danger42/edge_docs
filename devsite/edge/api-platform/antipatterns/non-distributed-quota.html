<p>Apigee Edge provides the ability to configure the number of allowed requests to an API Proxy for
a specific period of time using the {{quota_policy}}.</p>

<h2>Antipattern</h2>

<p>An API proxy request can be served by one or more distributed Edge components called
<em>Message Processors</em>. If there are multiple Message Processors configured for serving API
requests, then the quota will likely be exceeded because each Message Processor keeps itâ€™s own
"count" of the requests it processes.</p>

<p>Let's explain this with the help of an example. Consider the following {{quota_policy}} for an API
proxy:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/1-6.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>

<p>The above configuration should allow a total of 100 requests per hour.</p>

<p>In practice, however, when multiple message processors are serving the API requests, the
following happens:</p>

<p><img src="/api-platform/images/antipatterns/request-to-mps.png"/></p>

<p>In the above illustration:
<ul>
  <li>The quota policy is configured to allow 100 requests per hour.</li>
  <li>The requests to the API Proxy are being served by two Message Processors.</li>
  <li>Each Message Processor maintains its own quota count variable, <code>quota_count_mp1</code>
    and <code>quota_count_mp2</code>, to track the number of requests they are processing.</li>
  <li>Therefore each of the Message Processor will allow 100 API requests separately. The net effect
    is that a total of 200 requests are processed instead of 100 requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>This situation defeats the purpose of the quota configuration and can have detrimental effects on
the backend servers that are serving the requests.</p>

<p>The backend servers can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be stressed due to higher than expected incoming traffic</li>
  <li>Become unresponsive to newer API requests leading to 503 errors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practice</h2>

<p>Consider, setting the <code>&lt;Distributed&gt;</code> element to <code>true</code> in the {{quota_policy}} to
ensure that a common counter is used to track the API requests across all Message Processors.
The <code>&lt;Distributed&gt;</code> element can be set as shown in the code snippet below:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/1-7.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
