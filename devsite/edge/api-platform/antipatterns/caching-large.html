{% block title %}Storing data greater than 512kb size in cache{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

<p>Apigee Edge provides the ability to store data in a cache at runtime for persistence and faster
retrieval.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data is initially stored in the Message Processor’s in-memory cache, referred to as <em>L1
    cache</em>.</li>
  <li>The L1 cache is limited by the amount of memory reserved for it as a percentage of the JVM
    memory.</li>
  <li>The cached entries are later persisted in <em>L2 cache</em>, which is accessible to all Message
    Processors. More details can be found in the section below.</li>
  <li>The L2 cache does not have any hard limit on the number of cache entries, however the maximum
    <em>size</em> of the entry that can be cached is restricted to 512kb. The cache size of 512kb is the
    recommended size for optimal performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Antipattern</h2>

<p>This particular antipattern talks about the implications of exceeding the current cache size
restrictions within the Apigee Edge platform.</p>


<p>When data &gt; 512kb is cached, the consequences are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API requests executed for the first time on each of the Message Processors need to get the
    data independently from the original source (policy or a target server), as entries &gt; 512kb
    are not available in L2 cache.</li>
  <li>Storing larger data (&gt; 512kb) in L1 cache tends to put more stress on the platform
    resources. It results in the L1 cache memory being filled up faster and hence lesser space being
    available for other data. As a consequence, one will not be able to cache the data as
    aggressively as one would like to.</li>
  <li>Cached entries from the Message Processors will be removed when the limit on the number of
    entries is reached. This causes the data to be fetched from the original source again on the
    respective Message Processors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Data of size &gt; 512kb will not be stored in L2/persistent cache.</li>
  <li>More frequent calls to the original source (either a policy or a target server) leads to
    increased latencies for the API requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best practice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is preferred to store data of size &lt; 512kb in cache to get optimum performance.</li>
  <li>If there’s a need to store data &gt; 512kb, then consider:
    <ul>
      <li>Using any appropriate database for storing large data
        <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>Compressing the data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
