{% block title %}Logging data to third party servers using the JavaScript policy{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

<p>Logging is one of the efficient ways for debugging problems. The information about the API
request such as headers, form params, query params, dynamic variables, etc. can all be logged for
later reference. The information can be logged locally on the Message Processors ({{opdk}} only) or
to third party servers such as Sumo Logic, Splunk, or Loggly.</p>


<h2>Antipattern</h2>

<p>In the code below, the <code>httpClient</code> object in a {{javascript_policy}} is used to log the data to a
Sumo Logic server. This means that the process of logging actually takes place during
request/response processing. This approach is counterproductive because it adds to the processing
time, thereby increasing overall latencies.</p>

<p><strong>LogData_JS:</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/1-4.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>

<p><strong>LogData.js:</strong></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/1-5.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>

<p>The culprit here is the call to <code>waitForComplete()</code>, which suspends the caller's
operations until the logging process is complete. A valid pattern is to make this asynchronous
by eliminating this call.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Executing the logging code via the {{javascript_policy}} adds to the latency of the API
    request.</li>
  <li>Concurrent requests can stress the resources on the Message Processor and consequently
    adversely affecting the processing of other requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use the {{message_logging_policy}} to transfer/log data to Log servers or third party log
    management services such as Sumo Logic, Splunk, Loggly, etc.
  <li>The biggest advantage of the Message Logging policy is that it can be defined in the Post
    Client Flow, which gets executed after the response is sent back to the requesting client app.
  <li>Having this policy defined in Post Client flow helps separate the logging activity and the
    request/response processing thereby avoiding latencies.
  <li>If there is a specific requirement or a reason to do logging via JavaScript (not the Post
    Client flow option mentioned above), then it needs to be done asynchronously. In other words,
    if you are using a <code>httpClient</code> object, you would need to ensure that the JavaScript does
    <strong>NOT</strong> implement <code>waitForComplete</code>
</ul>
