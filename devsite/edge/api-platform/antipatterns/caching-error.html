<p>Caching is a process of storing data temporarily in a storage area called cache for future
reference. Caching data brings significant performance benefits because it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allows faster retrieval of data</li>
  <li>Reduces processing time by avoiding regeneration of data again and again</li>
  <li>Prevents API requests from hitting the backend servers and thereby reduces the overhead on
    the backend servers</li>
  <li>Allows better utilization of system/application resources</li>
  <li>Improves the response times of APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever we have to frequently access some data that doesn’t change too often, we highly
recommend to use a cache to store this data.</p>

<p>Apigee Edge provides the ability to store data in a cache at runtime for persistence and faster
retrieval. The caching feature is made available through the {{populate_cache_policy}},
{{lookup_cache_policy}}, {{invalidate_cache_policy}}, and {{response_cache_policy}}.</p>

<p>In this section, let’s look at Response Cache policy. The Response Cache policy in Apigee Edge
platform allows you to cache the responses from backend servers. If the client applications
make requests to the same backend resource repeatedly and the resource gets updated
periodically, then we can cache these responses using this policy. The Response Cache policy
helps in returning the cached responses and consequently avoids forwarding the requests
to the backend servers unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The Response Cache policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduces the number of requests reaching the backend</li>
  <li>Reduces network bandwidth</li>
  <li>Improves API performance and response times</li>
</ul>

<h2>Antipattern</h2>
<p>The {{response_cache_policy}} lets you cache HTTP responses with any possible Status code,
by default. This means that both success and error responses can be cached.

<p>Here’s a sample Response Cache policy with default configuration:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/1-1.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>

<p>The Response Cache policy caches error responses in its default
configuration. However, it is not advisable to cache error responses without
considerable thought on the adverse implications because:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#scenario1">Scenario 1</a>: Failures occur for a temporary, unknown period and we
    may continue to send error responses
    due to caching even after the problem has been fixed
    <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#scenario2">Scenario 2</a>: Failures will be observed for a fixed period of time,
    then we will have to modify the code to avoid caching responses once the problem is fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s explain this by taking these two scenarios in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="scenario1">Scenario 1: Temporary backend/resource failure</h2>

<p>Consider that the failure in the backend server is because of one of the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>A temporary network glitch</li>
  <li>The backend server is extremely busy and unable to respond to the requests for a temporary
    period</li>
  <li>The requested backend resource may be removed/unavailable for a temporary period of time</li>
  <li>The backend server is responding slow due to high processing time for a temporary period,
    etc</li>
</ul>

<p>In all these cases, the failures could occur for a unknown time period and then we may start
getting successful responses.  If we cache the error responses, then we may continue to send
error responses to the users even though the problem with the backend server has been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="scenario2">Scenario 2: Protracted or fixed backend/resource failure</h2>

<p>Consider that we know the failure in the backend is for a fixed period of time. For instance,
you are aware that either:
<ul>
  <li>A specific backend resource will be unavailable for 1 hour
    <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
  <li>The backend server is removed/unavailable for 24 hours due to a sudden site failure,
    scaling issues, maintenance, upgrade, etc.
</ul>

<p>With this information, we can set the cache expiration time appropriately in the Response Cache
policy so that we don’t cache the error responses for a longer time.  However, once the
backend server/resource is available again, we will have to modify the policy to avoid caching
error responses.  This is because if there is a temporary/one off failure from the backend
server, we will cache the response and we will end up with the problem explained in scenario 1 above.

<h2>Impact</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Caching error responses can cause error responses to be sent even after the problem has been
    resolved in the backend server</li>
  <li>Users may spend a lot of effort troubleshooting the cause of an issue without knowing that
    it is caused by caching the error responses from the backend server</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best practice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t store the error responses in the response cache. Ensure that the
    <code>&lt;ExcludeErrorResponse&gt;</code> element is set to <code>true</code> in the
    {{response_cache_policy}} to prevent error responses from being cached as shown in the below code
    snippet. With
    this configuration only the responses for the default success codes 200 to 205 (unless the
    success codes are modified) will be cached.
    <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/1-2.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you have the requirement to cache the error responses for some specific reason, then you
    can determine the maximum/exact duration of time for which the failure will be observed (if
    possible):
    <ul>
      <li>Set the Expiration time appropriately to ensure that you don’t cache the error responses
        longer than the time for which the failure can be seen.</li>
      <li>Use the ResponseCache policy to cache the error responses without the
        <code>&lt;ExcludeErrorResponse&gt;</code> element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do this <em>only if you are absolutely sure that the backend server failure is not for a
    brief/temporary period</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Apigee does not recommend caching 5xx responses from backend servers.</li>
</ul>

remove/disable the {{response_cache_policy}}. Otherwise,
the error responses for temporary backend server failures may get cached.</aside>
