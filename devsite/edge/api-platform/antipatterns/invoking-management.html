{% block title %}Invoking Management API calls from an API Proxy{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

<p>Edge has a powerful utility called “management APIs” which offers services such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deploying or undeploying API Proxies</li>
  <li>Configuring virtual hosts, keystores and truststores, etc.</li>
  <li>Creating, deleting and/or updating entities such as KeyValueMaps, API Products, Developer
    Apps, Developers, Consumer Keys, etc.</li>
  <li>Retrieving information about these entities</li>
</ul>

<p>These services are made accessible through a component called <em>Management Server</em> in the
Apigee Edge platform. These services can be invoked easily with the help of simple management API
calls.</p>

<p>Sometimes we may need to use one or more of these services from API Proxies at runtime. This is
because the entities such as KeyValueMaps, OAuth Access Tokens, API Products, Developer Apps,
Developers, Consumer Keys, etc. contain useful information in the form of key-value pairs, custom
attributes or as part of its profile.</p>

<p>For instance, you can store the following information in KeyValueMap to make it more secure and
accessible at runtime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Back-end target URLs</li>
  <li>Environment properties</li>
  <li>Security credentials of backend or third party systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, you may want to get the list of API Products or developer’s email address at runtime.
This information will be available as part of the Developer Apps profile.</p>

<p>All this information can be effectively used at runtime to enable dynamic behaviour in policies
or custom code within Apigee Edge.</p>

<h2>Antipattern</h2>

<p>The management APIs are preferred and useful for administrative tasks and should not be used for
performing any runtime logic in API Proxies flow. This is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using management APIs to access information about the entities such as KeyValueMaps, OAuth
    Access Tokens or for any other purpose from API Proxies leads to dependency on Management
    Servers.</li>
  <li>Management Servers are not a part of Edge runtime component and therefore, they may not be
    highly available.</li>
  <li>Management Servers also may not be provisioned within the same network or data center and may
    therefore introduce network latencies at runtime.</li>
  <li>The entries in the management servers are cached for longer period of time, so we may not be
    able to see the latest data immediately in the API Proxies if we perform writes and reads in a
      short period of time.</li>
  <li>Increases network hops at runtime.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the code sample below, the management API call is made via the custom JavaScript code to
retrieve the information from the KeyValueMap:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">var response = httpClient.send('https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/<var>org_name</var>/e/<var>env_name</var>/keyvaluemaps/<var>kvm_name</var>');
response.waitForComplete();</pre>

<p>If the management server is unavailable, then the JavaScript code invoking the management API
call fails. This subsequently causes the API request to fail.</p>


<h2>Impact</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Introduces additional dependency on Management Servers during runtime. Any failure in
    Management servers will affect the API calls.</li>
  <li>User credentials for management APIs need to be stored either locally or in some secure store
    such as Encrypted KVM.</li>
  <li>Performance implications owing to invoking the management service over the network.</li>
  <li>May not see the updated values immediately due to longer cache expiration in management
    servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best practice</h2>

<p>There are more effective ways of retrieving information from entities such as KeyValueMaps, API
Products, DeveloperApps, Developers, Consumer Keys, etc. at runtime. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a {{kvm_operations_policy}} to access information from KeyValueMaps. Here’s sample code
    that shows how to retrieve information from the KeyValueMap:
    <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-6.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To access information about API Products, Developer Apps, Developers, Consumer Keys, etc.
    in the API Proxy, you can do either of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>If your API Proxy flow has a {{verify_api_key_policy}}, then you can access the information
        using the flow variables populated as part of this policy. Here is sample code that shows
        how to retrieve the name and created_by information of a Developer App using JavaScript:
        <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-7.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
      </li>
      <li>If your API Proxy flow doesn’t have a VerifyAPIKey policy, then you can access the
        profiles of API Products, Developer Apps, etc. using the Access Entity and Extract Variables
        policies:
        <ol>
          <li>Retrieve the profile of DeveloperApp with the {{access_entity_policy}}:
            <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-8.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
          <li>Extract the <code>appId</code> from DeveloperApp with the {{extract_variables_policy}}:
            <pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/antipatterns/examples/2-9.xml" html_escape="True" %}</pre>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
