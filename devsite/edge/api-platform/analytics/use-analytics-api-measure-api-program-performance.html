  <p>This topic covers the Apigee Analytics Services API. Apigee Edge records a wide variety of
  operational and business data that flows across APIs. The metrics derived from this data are
  useful for operational monitoring and business monitoring. Using Analytics Services, you can, for
  example, determine which APIs are performing well or poorly, which developers are delivering the
  highest value traffic, and which apps are causing the most issues for your backend services.</p>

  <p>To help access this data easily, Apigee Edge Analytics Services exposes a RESTful API. You can
  use this API when you need to automate certain Analytics functions, such as retrieving metrics
  periodically using an automation client or script. You can also use the API to build your own
  visualizations in the form of custom widgets that you can embed in portals or custom apps.</p>

  <p>This topic demonstrates the RESTful Analytics API. To learn how to use Analytics in the API
  Edge management UI see <a href="/api-platform/analytics/analytics-services-overview.html">Analytics Services overview</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="gettingthenumberofapicallspermonth">Getting the number of API calls per month</h2>

  <p>If you want to see the total number of calls made to your APIs per month, see the
    <a href="/management/apis/get/organizations/{org_name}/stats">Get API message counts</a>SmartDocs management API.</p>

  <p>The API must be run for each organization and each envronment. Here's the call in cURL:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -v "https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org}/environments/{environment}/stats/?select=sum(message_count)&amp;timeRange=03/01/2016%2000:00~03/31/2016%2024:00" -u email
</pre>

  <p>Dates/times are in UTC and use the following format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM, with the range
  separated by a tilde (~). For cURL, the %20 URL encoding is required for the space between
  the date and time.</p>

  <p>This is an abbreviated version of the /stats API, which provides additional query parameters
  and dimension resource paths for more granular analytics reporting. For more information, see
  <a href="/management/apis/get/organizations/{org_name}/environments/{env_name}/stats/{dimension_name}-0">Get metrics organized by dimensions</a>,
    as well as the information that follows.</p>

  <h2 id="gettingmetricswiththemanagementapi">Getting metrics with the management API</h2>

  <p>Use the <a href="/management/apis/get/organizations/{org_name}/environments/{env_name}/stats/{dimension_name}-0">Get metrics organized by dimensions</a>
    management API to get API metrics over a specified time
  period. In Apigee Edge, metrics can be shown in the context of dimensions, or groupings. For
  example, you may have gotten 20,000 API calls over the past hour. Dimensions make that data more
  meaningful by grouping the numbers. When you use the "API proxy" dimension to retrieve the
  traffic metrics, you'll see that API proxy A got 10,000 calls, API proxy B got 6,000 calls, and
  API proxy C got 4,000 calls.</p>

  <p>For example, to get metrics grouped by API proxies, you'd use the following base URL to call
  the management API (the type of metrics and other API controls are provided with query
  parameters, not shown here):</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env_name}/stats/apiproxy

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In this topic, you will get metrics for the set of built-in

    MM/DD/YYYY%20HH:MM~MM/DD/YYYY%20HH:MM.</p>

      <p>Notice the "%20" before "HH:MM". The TimeRange requires an URL-encoded space character
      before HH:MM, or a "+" character, as in: MM/DD/YYYY+HH:MM~MM/DD/YYYY+HH:MM.</p>

  <p>Let's suppose that you want to get metrics for your API proxies that are deployed in the test
  environment. You want to find out how many request messages were received by all API proxies
  between 6/24/2017 and 6/25/2017. You want to find out a daily count for messages that were
  received. To do so, you create a select statement on the
  <code>/stats/apiproxy</code> resource.</p>

  <p>The example below demonstrates who you would construct a request for these metrics. The select
  statement defines the aggregate function <code>sum</code> for the metric
  <code>message_count</code> on the dimension <code>apiproxy</code> deployed in the
  <code>test</code> environment. The report provides a snapshot of the request message throughput
  to all APIs for traffic received between the beginning of 6/20/2017 and the end of 6/21/2017, in
  UTC time:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/test/stats/apiproxy?"select=sum(message_count)&amp;timeRange=06/20/2017%2000:00~06/21/2017%2023:59&amp;timeUnit=day" \
-u <var>email</var>:<var>password</var>
</pre>

  <p>Sample Response:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "environments" : [ {
    "dimensions" : [ {
      "metrics" : [ {
        "name" : "sum(message_count)",
        "values" : [ {
          "timestamp" : 1498003200000,
          "value" : "1100.0"
        } ]
      } ],
      "name" : "target-reroute"
    } ],
    "name" : "test"
  } ]...
}
</pre>

  <p>This response indicates that 1100 message were received by one API proxy called
  'target-reroute' running in the test environment between the start of 6/20/2017 and the end of
  6/21/2017, UTC time.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> Note that the timestamp, <code>1498003200000</code>, is in
  Unix timestamp format. There are many Unix timestamp conversion tools available on the Internet
  that you can use to decode these timestamps.</aside>

  <p>To get metrics for other dimensions, specify a different dimension as the URI parameter. For
  example, you can specify the <code>developer_app</code> dimension to retrieve metrics for
  developer apps. The following report shows the total throughput (messages received) from any apps
  for the specified time interval:</p>

  <h2 id="sortingresultsbyrelativeranking">Sorting results by relative ranking</h2>

  <p>Many times when getting metrics, you only want to get results for a subset of the total set of
  data. Usually, you need to get the results for the "top 10", for example, the "top 10 slowest
  APIs", the "top 10 most active apps". You can do this using the <code>topk</code> query parameter
  as part of the request.</p>

  <p>For example you may be interested to know who your top developers are, measured by throughput,
  or what your worst performers (i.e., 'top slowest') target APIs are by latency.</p>

  <p>The <code>topk</code> (meaning 'top k' entities) enables reporting on the entities associated
  with the highest value for a given metric. This enables you to filter metrics for a list of
  entities that exemplify a particular condition. For example, to find which target URL was the
  most error prone over the last week, the <code>topk</code> parameter is appended to the request,
  with a value of <code>1</code>.</p>

  <p>In the example below</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/test/stats/target_url?"select=sum(is_error)&amp;timeRange=05/08/2017%2000:00~05/15/2017%2000:00&amp;timeUnit=week&amp;sortby=sum(is_error)&amp;topk=1" -u <var>email</var>:<var>password</var>

  <h2 id="paginatingresults">Paginating results</h2>

  <p>In production environments, some request to the Analytics Services API return very large data
  sets. To make it easy to display large data sets in the context of a UI-based application, the
  API natively supports pagination.</p>

  <p>To paginate results, use the <code>offset</code> and <code>limit</code> query parameters,
  along with the <code>sortby</code> sorting parameter to ensure a consistent ordering of
  items.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> When paginating results, it's important to sort results in a predictable way using
    the <code>sortby</code> query parameter. Without sorting, results are returned in an
    unpredictable order, which defeats the purpose of pagination.

    <p>The <code>sortby</code> value must be the same as one used in the <code>select</code> query
    parameter. For example, if <code>select=sum(message_count)</code>, then
    <code>sortby=sum(message_count)</code>.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>For example, the following request would be likely to return a large data set, since it
  retrieves metrics for all errors on all APIs in the product environment for the last week.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/prod/stats/apiproxy?"select=sum(is_error)&amp;timeRange=05/08/2017%2000:00~05/15/2017%2000:00&amp;timeUnit=week&amp;sortby=sum(is_error)" \
-u <var>email</var>:<var>password</var>
</pre>

  <p>If your UI-based application can reasonably display 50 results per page, you can set the limit
  to 50. Since 0 counts as the first item, the following call returns items 0-49 in descending
  order (<code>sort=DESC</code> is the default).</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/prod/stats/apiproxy?"select=sum(is_error)&amp;timeRange=05/08/2017%2000:00~05/15/2017%2000:00&amp;timeUnit=week&amp;<strong>sortby=sum(is_error)&amp;limit=50&amp;offset=0</strong>" \
-u <var>email</var>:<var>password</var>
</pre>

  <p>For the second 'page' of results, use the offset query parameter, as follows. Note that the
  limit and offset are identical. That's because 0 counts as the first item. With a limit of 50 and
  an offset of 0, items 0-49 are returned. With an offset of 50, items 50-99 are returned.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
