  <h2 id="whatdoesacustomreporttellme">What does a custom report tell me?</h2>

  <p>A custom report is a way to specify precisely what you want to measure across your API
  program. For instance, you can measure all API traffic generated from a specific client IP
  address. For information on creating custom reports, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/create-custom-reports.html">Manage custom reports</a>.</p>

  <p>A custom report is similar in look and feel to analytics dashboards, however the data that's
  displayed depends on the metrics and drill-down dimensions you selected when you created the
  custom report.</p>
