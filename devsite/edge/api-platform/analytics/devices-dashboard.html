  <h2 id="whatdoesthisdashboardtellme">What does this dashboard tell me?</h2>

  <p>The Devices dashboard tells you about the devices and servers that are being used to access
  your APIs. It lets you spot trends in how users are accessing your APIs. For instance, you might
  notice that traffic from one type of device is increasing, while another is going down, and then
  decide if the change requires any action or not.</p>

  <h2 id="whatelsedoineedtoknowaboutthisdashboard">What else do I need to know about this
  dashboard?</h2>

  <p>You can view data for all API proxies in your organization, or you can select individual APIs
  to analyze. When traffic origination cannot be determined, it is recorded as "Others".</p>

  <p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering
  over graphs for more context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see <a href=
