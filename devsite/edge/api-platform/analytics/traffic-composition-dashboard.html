  <h2 id="whatdoesthisdashboardtellme">What does this dashboard tell me?</h2>

  <p>The Traffic Composition dashboard measures the relative contribution of your top APIs, apps,
  developers, and products to your overall API program.</p>

  <p>Use the report to detect business problems such as lower traffic trends or diminishing
  contribution from key apps and developers. Based on this data, you can decide what corrective
  action to take. You can also get early notification of new entities that contribute to API
  traffic, and take actions to respond &#8212; for example, you can determine which new developers
  are highly contributing and include them in nurturing programs.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The Traffic Composition dashboard requires data range queries to
  be more than a month (for example, November 30 to December 31). Queries over less than a month
  return an empty page (for example, December 1 to December 31).</aside>

  <p>This dashboard has two measurement modes, which you select with the <strong>Overview</strong>
  and <strong>By Dimension</strong> buttons.</p>

        generating the most traffic.</td>

        <td>Let's you drill in to see a more detailed view of proxy, developer app, product, and

  <h3 id="whatdoesthisdashboardmeasure-whattheoverviewmodetellsyou">What the Overview mode tells
  you</h3>

  <p>Click <strong>Overview</strong> to display this mode. This mode presents a set of
  straight-forward graphs showing traffic patterns proxies, developer apps, developers, and
  products.</p>

  <p>The following figure shows part of the traffic composition overview page:</p>

  <table width="660">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="222"><strong>Metric</strong></td>

        <td width="426"><strong>Description</strong></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Top 10 Proxies Traffic</td>

        <td>Shows the top 10 proxies measured by API traffic.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Top 10 Apps Traffic</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Top 10 Products Traffic</td>

        <td>Shows the top 10 products measured by API traffic.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Top 10 Developers Traffic</td>

        <td>Shows the top 10 developers measured by API traffic.</td>

  </table>

  <h3 id="whatdoesthisdashboardmeasure-whatthebydimensionmodetellsyou">What the By Dimension mode
  tells you</h3>

  <p>Click <strong>By Dimension</strong> to display this mode.</p>

  <p>Click <strong>Overview</strong> to display this mode. This mode lets you drill in to see
  traffic pattern details for <strong>specific</strong> proxies, developer apps, developers, and
  products. For example, you can see at a glance how traffic for a specific proxy compares to all
  other proxies.</p>

  <p>1. Select a dimension to examine. Dimensions include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Proxies</li>

    <li>Developer Apps</li>

    <li>Developers</li>

    <li>Products</li>
  </ul>

  <p>2. Select the dimension instance to examine. For example, if the dimension is
  <strong>Developers</strong>, select a developer from the dropdown list, or select
  <strong>All</strong> to see metrics on all developers.</p>

  <p>If you select <strong>All</strong> for a dimension, the dashboard offers charts that compare
  all entities together. For example, the Traffic by Dimension chart compares API proxy traffic for
  all API proxies in the organization.</p>

  <p>Charts you will see in this mode include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#trafficcomposition">Traffic composition</a></li>

    <li><a href="#trafficbydimension">Traffic by dimension</a></li>

    <li><a href="#top10monthlycomp">Top 10 monthly composition</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="trafficcomposition">Traffic Composition</h4>

  <p>Shows the traffic for all entities of the selected dimension or all entities combined over the
  selected time interval.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>All Dimensions Traffic</td>

        <td>Shows the traffic for all of the selected dimension in one chart. Dimensions can
        include API proxies, developer apps, developers, or products.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Proxy-specific traffic</td>

        <td>Shows the traffic for the selected dimension.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4 id="top10monthlycomp">Top 10 Monthly Composition</h4>

  <p>This view's pie charts let you quickly compare traffic patterns for all of your proxies,
  developer apps, products, or developers.</p>

  <h2 id="whatelsedoineedtoknowaboutthisdashboard">What else do I need to know about this
  dashboard?</h2>

  <p>Use the dropdown menus to select (a) dimensions to examine (proxies, developer apps,
  developers, or products), and (b) specific entities to measure (either a specific entity like a
  proxy, or all proxies, for example).</p>

  <p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering
  over graphs for more context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see <a href=
