  <h2 id="ax_firstthingsfirst">First things first: How to generate complete analytics data</h2>

  <p>Getting complete analytics for your API program requires a few prerequisite steps. What do we
  mean by complete analytics? You could, for example, create an API proxy that anyone in the world
  could call, and Apigee will generate metrics about that API proxy. But what about metrics for the
  developer or app that called the API proxy? If Apigee doesn't know who made an API call
  (developer and app), it obviously can't generate those metrics.</p>

  <p>A few steps are therefore needed to let Apigee figure out which developers and which developer
  apps are calling your API proxies.</p>

  <p>The following tutorials quickly guide you through the necessary steps that let you see
  analytics for developers and apps: <a href=
  "/api-platform/tutorials/secure-calls-your-api-through-api-key-validation.html">Secure an API by
  requiring API keys</a> and <a href=
  "/api-platform/tutorials/secure-calls-your-api-through-oauth-20-client-credentials.html">Secure
  an API with OAuth</a>.</p>

  <p>For quick reference, here's a list of those steps with links to more detailed information:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Create one or more API products</strong>, which function as security gatekeepers
      for API calls. See <a href="/api-platform/publish/create-api-products.html">Create API
      products</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Register developers</strong> with Apigee. See <a href=
      "/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product.html">Managing app
      developers</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Register applications</strong> and generate API keys for those developers. See
      <a href="/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api.html">Register apps and manage
      API keys</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Add security policies to your API proxies</strong> that verify API keys and/or
      security tokens. See the following topics: <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/verify-api-key-policy.html">Verify API Key
      policy</a>, <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/oauthv2-policy.html">OAuthV2
      policy</a>, and <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/verify-jwt-policy.html">Verify
      JWT policy (Beta version)</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>After you complete these steps, you can use the <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/api-program-view-dashboard.html">Apigee dashboard</a>, the <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/partner-engagement-dashboard.html">Developer engagement</a> dashboard,
  or generate <a href="/api-platform/analytics/custom-report-dashboard.html">custom analytics
  reports</a> that show metrics for developers and apps.</p>

  <h2 id="improveyourapithroughanalytics">Improve your API through analytics</h2>

  <p>Apigee Edge Analytics Services collects and analyzes a wealth of information that flows
  through APIs. This information is gathered, analyzed, and provided to you
  immediately,<strong> </strong>in real time. How is your API traffic trending over time? Who
  are your top developers? When is API response time fastest? Slowest? Are you attracting more
  developers? Geographically where do you see the most API traffic? </p>

  <p>The answers to questions like these help you improve your APIs, attract the right app
  developers, troubleshoot problems, and, ultimately, make better business decisions related to
  your API program.</p>

  <h2 id="insightthatleadstoaction">Insight that leads to action</h2>

  <p>Let's say your API has gained wide adoption. It's <em>popular</em>. You have attracted a
  number of talented, creative app developers and people are downloading and installing their apps.
  Obviously, the API team is very interested in how the API is performing, how it's being used, and
  how to plan for improvements. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/analyticsOverview7.png"></p>

  <p>To plan those improvements, the API team needs to know as much as they can about how the API
  is used in the real world. How is it performing? Who is using it? What are the traffic patterns?
  They need <strong>insight</strong>. They need to know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What's changed? Knowing when and where something about an API changed helps you to take
    corrective action.</li>

    <li>What are our <strong>top apps</strong>? You need to know who/which apps are using your
    API.</li>

    <li>Who are our <strong>best app developers</strong>? Your best users and developers might
    be operating with you across multiple apps and devices, such as website, mobile apps, video
    game consoles, and tablets.</li>

    <li>Which API <strong>methods</strong> are most popular? Your API is a product;
    you want to understand its usage to help pivot your business and make future investment
    decisions.</li>

    <li>How much API <strong>capacity</strong> will be needed next year? Capacity
    planning is difficult. What if your API goes viral and you have millions of users? You need
    trending usage data to help make these decisions. In this context, you want to see indicators
    in the trend charts like the number of requests (the load hitting the backend systems), volume
    of data (especially for API responses), and so on.</li>

    <li>Why is the API down? There&#8217;s probably not one thing to tell you why an API is
    down, but the shape of your graphs can help. Do your charts show catastrophic failure or a slow
    lead-in to failure?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Through a continual process
  of <strong>collecting</strong>, <strong>analyzing</strong>,
  and <strong>visualizing</strong> API metrics, Analytics Services helps your API
  team <strong>act</strong> to improve their APIs. Out-of-the-box, Analytics
  Services supports and encourages this pattern of collect, analyze, visualize, and act. </p>

  <h2 id="whatkindofdataiscollectedandanalyzed">What kind of data is collected and analyzed?</h2>

  <p>Analytics Services collects and analyzes a broad spectrum of data that flows across APIs. For
  example, while your API is deployed, the analytics system is constantly counting and analyzing
  metrics like the <strong>number of messages received</strong>, <strong>number of
  developers</strong>, <strong>response
  times</strong>, <strong>errors</strong>, <strong>number of apps in
  use</strong>, <strong>request size</strong>, and many others. For a good introduction to
  metrics and how you can use them, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/use-analytics-api-measure-api-program-performance.html">Use the
  analytics API to measure API program performance</a>. For a complete listing of metrics, see
  <a href="/api-platform/analytics/analytics-reference.html">Analytics metrics, dimensions, and
  filters reference</a>.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/traffic-comp-main.png"></p>

  <p>You can also create <strong>custom metrics</strong> by wiring together features of
  Analytics Services and API Services. For example, you can create a policy designed to extract
  certain information from an API (from request headers, for instance). Once extracted, you can use
  the analytics API to analyze and return the data. For example, you might ask: When does the
  highest response time usually occur for a specific API? The answer to a question like this might
  help your Ops team plan for anticipated network loads. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/analyze-api-message-content-using-custom-analytics.html">Analyze API
  message content using custom analytics</a> for a nice end-to-end example demonstrating this
  technique.</p>

  <h2 id="anewbreedofdata">A new breed of data</h2>

  <p>You've stored and collected metrics on system performance, you've collected error logs, you've
  collected user data, and you've collected many other kinds of data related to your business
  systems and the applications that run on them. Often this data is collected and stored in data
  warehouses where it is organized and possibly analyzed in predictable ways according to
  traditional models like ETL (extract, transform, load). </p>

  <p>With the rapid adoption of APIs and a mobile apps economy, understanding what to measure is
  less predictable than it once was. Third-party app developers have access to your APIs. Users are
  on the go. They have smart phones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Some may never use a
  browser. In this rapidly shifting environment, you need to know exactly how, when, and where they
  are interacting with your APIs. You need to know how your APIs are performing right now, in real
  time.</p>

  <div class="video">
    <p><strong>Video: </strong>For more about this perspective, check out this short
    video. It explains how API data is a new breed of data, that exists <strong>at
    the edge</strong> of your enterprise, and that is critical to the success of your API
    program. <span style="font-size: 12px;"> </span></p>

  <h2 id="putanalyticsupfrontabestpractice">Put analytics up front (a best practice)</h2>

  <p>Apigee encourages API teams to put analytics up front. Think of analytics as <strong>your
  API's peer</strong>, as an integral part of your API program from the beginning, not as something
  you consider or decide to add later in your API program.</p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><img alt="" src=
  "/api-platform/images/analyticsOverview10.png"> </span></p>

  <p>Analytics can provide key information at the beginning of your API program to help you improve
  your API and the experience of app developers who use it. As your API program matures, analytics
  lends insight that can inform key business decisions. <span style=
  "font-size: 12px;"> </span></p>

  <h2 id="yourapiataglance">Your API at a glance</h2>

  <p>Analytics Services provides several visualization tools, including the Dashboard, custom
  reports, GeoMap, and tools that visualize trends in API proxy performance. For now, let's
  take a quick look at three of these tools: the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, <strong>proxy
  resource performance view</strong>, and <strong>custom reports. </strong></p>

  <h3 id="yourapiataglance-thedashboard">The Dashboard</h3>

  <p>The analytics Dashboard gives an overall view of your entire API program. You can toggle the
  dashboard between the <strong>API program view</strong>, which gives you a sense of overall
  API performance, and <strong>API top performer view</strong>, which tells you about your top
  performing APIs, apps, developers, and API products. You can select a time interval (hour, day,
  week, month) over which the data is plotted or specify a custom timespan. You can also mouse
  over any point on a plot to see in greater detail what was happening at that point. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/ax-overview-1.png"></p>

  <h3 id="yourapiataglance-proxyresourceperformanceview">Proxy resource performance view</h3>

  <p>You also can track performance metrics for individual URIs (resources) for a specific API
  proxy on the <strong>Performance</strong> tab for any API proxy in the proxy editor.</p>

  <h3 id="yourapiataglance-customreports">Custom reports</h3>

  <p>The custom report feature lets you select, combine, filter, and drill down into specific API
  metrics. You can generate reports that contain the exact data that you want to see. Reports can
  be viewed in the UI, exported to CSV, PDF, or PNG files. In addition, you can create your
  own analytics dashboard and populate it with custom reports that you select.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/Custom-reports-list.png"></p>

  <p>For more information about the visualization tools provided by Analytics Services, see
  <a href="/api-platform/analytics/analytics-dashboards.html">Analytics dashboards</a>. For more
  information on custom reports, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/create-custom-reports.html">Create custom reports</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="fetchanalyticsdatawiththerestapi">Fetch analytics data with the REST API</h2>

  <p>Using the Analytics Services API, you can access a wide variety of operational and business
  data that flows across your APIs. For example, using REST calls, you can determine which APIs are
  performing well or poorly, which developers are delivering the highest value traffic, and which
  apps are causing the most issues for your backend services.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The analytics dashboard is implemented using the REST
  API.</aside>

  <p>You can use the REST API when you need to automate certain analytics functions, such as
  retrieving metrics periodically using an automation client or script. You can also use the API to
  build your own visualizations in the form of custom widgets that you can embed in portals or
  custom apps. The API can also be used to provide custom analytics to certain app developers or
  communities of app developers. </p>

  <p>Here's an example analytics REST API call:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/test/stats/apiproxy?"select=sum(message_count)&amp;timeRange=6/24/2017%2000:00~6/24/2017%2023:59&amp;timeUnit=hour" \
-u email:password
</pre>

  <p>This call tells you how many request messages were received on an hourly basis, grouped by all
  API proxies, on 6/24/2017 (00:00 to 23:59 UTC time). (%20 is a URL-encoded space.)</p>

  <p>To read all about the REST API for analytics, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/use-analytics-api-measure-api-program-performance.html">Use the
  analytics API to measure API program performance</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="sharedatawithappdevelopers">Share data with app developers</h2>

  <p>When you think of app developers as your customers, you'll want to make sure they have the
  tools and information available to them to make the best use of your API. Ultimately, you want
  the people who use their apps (and your products and services) to be happy.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/analyticsOverview6.png"></p>

  <p>Analytics Services provides a wealth of information that app developers can use to improve
  their apps. App developers are not only concerned about the quality of their apps, they are very
  interested in your API. How is it performing? Is it error prone? Is it sometimes unavailable? How
  does it respond to traffic spikes? Answers to these questions are crucial to the app
  developer who wants to deliver the best possible experience to their (your) customers!</p>

  <p>First, the developer portal includes an optional <strong>App Performance</strong> page
  designed to give app developers access to important metrics for their apps. This page gives
  developers information about: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Errors:</b> Which API errors is my app seeing? What is the rate of errors?
    Where are they appearing in the code? </li>

    <li><b>Performance:</b> Is the API slow right now? Which API methods are typically
    slow or slow at the moment? </li>

    <li><b>Availability:</b> Is the API up or down right now? When will the API be back
    up? Why was the API down?</li>

    <li><b>Quota:</b> Does your API have a quota? And as the app developer, how am I doing
    against the quota? Am I violating the quota? </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also create custom reports and share them with your app developers. For more
  information, see <a href="/api-platform/analytics/create-custom-reports.html">Create custom
  reports</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, organization administrators can use the analytics management API to capture data over
  a wider period of time to share with app developers offline. For more information, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/analytics/use-analytics-api-measure-api-program-performance.html">Use the
  analytics API to measure API program performance</a>.<span style=
  "font-size: 12px;"> </span></p>

  <h2 id="receivedailysummaryreports">Receive daily summary reports</h2>

  <p>{% dynamic include /includes/___edge-price-plan-note %}</p>

  <p>Organization Administrators can opt in and out of being emailed daily analytics reports. In
  the management UI, select <strong>username &gt; User Settings</strong>, and select or deselect
  the <strong>Receive daily analytics summary report</strong> option. You can also use
  the <a href=
  "/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/stats/preferences/reports/dailysummaryreport">/stats/preferences/dailysummaryreport
  API</a> to subscribe or unsubscribe from daily analytics emails. For example, to opt out,
  use:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org}/stats/preferences/reports/dailysummaryreport?optin=false
</pre>

  <h2 id="learnasyougoanotherbestpractice">Learn as you go (another best practice)</h2>

  <p>With the analytics tools provided by Apigee, you can collect and monitor a lot of data, which
  can be overwhelming. Apigee recommends that you start slowly by collecting and analyzing a few
  key metrics. Use what you learn to improve your APIs and the apps that use them. As you are
  successful, you can collect and analyze more data to make further improvements. Ultimately, API
  analytics can provide a powerful 360-degree view of your entire API ecosystem and help you
  improve your overall business.</p>

  <h2 id="bottomlineapianalyticshelpseveryoneimprove">Bottom line: API Analytics helps everyone
  improve</h2>

  <p>From the app developer to the business owner, <strong>API analytics help everyone
  improve</strong>. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/analyticsOverview8.png"></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>API Team</strong> - The API team is tapping into internal systems to create
    interesting APIs. The <strong>API team</strong> wants to know how the API
    program is doing overall, how individual APIs are doing, and how to improve their
    APIs. </li>

    <li><strong>App Developers</strong> - By sharing analytics information
    with <strong>app developers</strong>, you get better apps. These developers are innovating
    with your API and building creative apps that help drive revenue to your enterprise. Analytics
    help app developers know how their apps are doing and how much they are contributing to
    the bottom line of your enterprise. App developers want to know how they can improve their
    apps. Ultimately, everyone wants happy end users. </li>

    <li><strong>Ops Team</strong> - Equally, the <strong>operations
    team</strong> wants to understand traffic patterns and anticipate when to add backend
    resources or make other critical adjustments. </li>

    <li><strong>Business Owner </strong>-  The <strong>business
    owner</strong> wants to see how their API investment is paying off and where to invest API
    dollars in the future. Ultimately, the business owner wants to improve their business.</li>
