  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}What does an analytics entity value "(not set)"
  mean?{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>As you review your analytics, you may see an entity value of
    <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">(not set)</span> displayed, including the
  parenthesis, for your <strong>API Proxies</strong>, <strong>Product</strong>,
  <strong>Developer</strong>, <strong>Developer Apps</strong> and other dimensions. This
  may or may not be an issue.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, <code>(not set)</code> means <b>Edge doesn't have enough information</b>. For
  example, developer apps are associated with developers, API products, and by extension API
  proxies. When a developer app makes an API call with an API key or OAuth token, all those
  associations are made in analytics. However, if an API proxy is open and doesn't require an API
  key, Edge has no way of knowing if there is a developer, developer app, or product associated
  with the API call.</p>

<p>Other times, <code>(not set)</code> could mean <b>doesn't apply</b>. For example, the "Flow
  Name on Error" dimension shows the named API proxy flows where errors occurred. In that case, all
  non-error calls will be shown as <code>(not set)</code> because there was no error in the
  calls.</p>

  <p>The following table summarizes possible explanations for why you are seeing
    <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(not set)</span> on a particular
  dimensions.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Dimension</th>
    <th>Possible Meaning of "(not set)"</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>API Proxy</td>
     <td>A call to an API proxy reached the Apigee routers, but was malformed,
      never reached the proxy, and the message processor returned a 404 status code with a
      classification error. This means that there are some callers that are making malformed
      calls.</td>

     <td>API Product</td>
     <td>Not all of your API proxies and developer apps are using products. For information about how to get your API proxies and developer apps to use products, see
