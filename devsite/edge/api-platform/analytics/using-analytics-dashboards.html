  <p>Analytics dashboards help you see and detect changes in your API ecosystem at a glance. The
  ability to see what has changed over time helps you identify problems and take corrective action
  quickly.</p>

  <p>For a quick overview of Analytics Services, who uses them, and why, see
    <a href="/api-platform/analytics/analytics-services-overview.html">Analytics Services overview</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> There is a limit to the amount of data that can be reported in
  the Analytics dashboards. If the amount of analytics data returned by the query exceeds this
  limit, then the dashboard will display the results for a partial set of data and a warning will
  be displayed on the dashboard (Public Cloud only).  </aside>

  <h2 id="whatyoulllearninthistopic">What you'll learn in this topic</h2>

  <p>This topic explains how some of the common features you'll find in all the dashboards. After
  reading this topic, you will understand:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The general layout of all dashboards</li>

    <li>Common features all dashboards share and how to use them</li>

    <li>A few tricks and tips that will help you get the most out of the analytics dashboards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="whatcanyoulearnfromthedashboards">What can you learn from the dashboards?</h2>

  <p>Has there been a sudden spike or drop off in API traffic? Which app developers are most
  successful? What is the adoption rate of your API among developers? Which API methods are most
  popular? The Edge Analytics dashboards are designed specifically to answer questions like
  these. </p>

  <p>In the background, Apigee Edge collects information as data passes through your APIs. The
  dashboards provide a powerful way to use this data immediately. If you see something of interest
  in a graph or chart, an anomaly or sudden change, you can then drill deeper to uncover as much
  detail as you require. If you notice that a particular developer is experiencing a lot of errors
  or a sudden drop in traffic, you can contact that developer proactively. Dashboards give you
  insight into your APIs that allows you to take action. </p>

  <h2 id="canicustomizethedashboards">Can I customize the dashboards?</h2>

  <div>
    Yes, many dashboards let you select which metrics to analyze, date ranges, data aggregation
    intervals, and many other variables. If the built-in dashboards do not suit your needs, you can
    create custom reports, which are dashboards you create by selecting the analytic dimensions and
    metrics that you wish to analyze. Custom reports let you "drill down" into your API's analytic
    data until you achieve the granularity you require.

  <h2 id="howarethedashboardsorganized">How are the dashboards organized?</h2>

  <p>Most of the Apigee Analytics dashboards are organized and function much like the one below. If
  you understand how to use this dashboard, you'll be comfortable navigating the others.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data range and aggregation settings</strong> - Let you select the of dates for
    which to display data and the aggregation or "granularity" of data to display. </li>

    <li><strong>Graph syles</strong> - All dashboards include one or more graphical charts,
    including line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> When you select a smaller aggregation interval the larger the
  dataset the dashboard is working with. Performance tends to increase when you select a larger
  aggregation interval. For example, performance is greater if you select <strong>By Day</strong>
  rather than <strong>By Minute</strong>.</aside>

  <h2 id="whatarethemostcommonfeaturesinthedashboards">What are the most common features in the
  dashboards?</h2>

  <p>Dashboards have a set of common features, including time range and data aggregation settings,
  view togbgles, click and drag zooming on charts, mouse-over hover for more details on charts and
  other regions, and selectors for choosing the data to display in a chart. If you understand how
  to use one kind of dashboard, you'll be comfortable using the others.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Toggle the view</strong> - Some dashboards let you toggle between distinct views or
    toggle between Detail and Summary views. </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Set the time range</strong> - You can select the time range over which the dashboard
      displays its data. Select <strong>Custom</strong> to use a calendar-style date picker to
      select the interval.

      <aside class="note">
        <b>Note:</b> For Cloud-based installations, data older than six months from the current
        date is not accessible by default. If you want to access data older than six months,
        contact <a href="https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee Support</a>.

        <p>For Private Cloud installations, the maximum time frame for running custom reports
        through the UI is 15 days. To increase that to 31 days:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Add the following line to <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&lt;install_root&gt;/apigee4/conf/ui/apigee.conf</span>:<br>

          <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">apigee.feature.enableForceRangeLimit="false"</span></li>

          <li>Restart the UI (you may have to clear your browser cache to get the new
          behavior):<br>
          <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">apigee4/bin/apigee-service ui restart</span></li>
        </ol>
      </aside>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Select the data aggregation interval</strong> - The aggregation interval ranges
    from minute, hour, day, week, and month. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: When you select a smaller aggregation interval the larger the dataset the dashboard is
  working with. Performance tends to increase when you select a larger aggregation interval. For
  example, performance is greater if you select By Day rather than By Minute.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zoom in</strong> - You can zoom in on chart data by clicking and
    dragging. </li>

    <li><strong>Hover mouse over graphs</strong> - You can mouse over any point on a graph for more
    context about the data at that point.</li>

    <li><strong>Hover mouse over labels</strong> - You can sometimes hover over a label for
    more details. Look for the "?" cursor as you mouse around. </li>

    <li><strong>Export data to file</strong> - Click <b>Combined CSV</b> to download a single CSV
    file that contains a combined set of data from all charts on the page. Alternatively, click
    <b>CSV</b> adjacent to a chart to download data specific to that chart only.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following figure highlights these feature areas:</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/api-traffic-annotated_png.png" width="949"></p>

  <p>Here's another dashboard that includes additional features that you'll see in some other
  dashboards:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Refresh button</strong> - Updates the dashboard with the latest data.</li>

    <li><strong>Export data to a file</strong> - Select the data format from the
    <strong>Export</strong> menu.</li>

    <li><strong>Feature selections</strong> - Lets you show or hide certain features of the
    dashboard like <a href="#Anomalies">investigating anomolies</a> and showing
      <a href="#MovingAverages">moving averages</a>. </li>

    <li><strong>Dropdown menu for metric selection</strong> - Let's you pick the data dimension
    that you wish to plot.</li>

    <li><strong>Plot selectors</strong> - Lets you select which set of data you wish to plot. In
    the example below, you can select which API proxy you wish to plot. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following figure highlights each of these feature areas:</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/dashboard-performance.png" width="966"></p>

  <h2 id="analyzingspikesordropsintrafficanomalies"><a id="Anomalies" name="Anomalies"></a>Analyzing spikes or drops in traffic (anomalies)</h2>

  <p>If you see a dramatic rise (a "spike") or a dramatic drop in the traffic, you can get further
  detail, by checking the Investigate Anomalies checkbox on the API Proxies page and clicking on a
  point in the chart that corresponds to the spike or drop.</p>

  <div class="video">
    <p>Watch a short video to learn how the Anomaly investigation tool works. </p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="312" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/89554167" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In response, you'll be able to view the traffic pattern before, at, and after the spike or
  drop. You can display the Investigate Anomalies data by any of the dimensions available by
  default in Apigee Edge as well as by custom dimensions. This gives you enhanced insight into the
  cause of a spike or drop and enables you to correlate it to factors such as developer, developer
  app, resource, client IP address, or target URL.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/Investigate-anomalies.png" width="600"></p>

  <h2 id="viewingmovingaveragesandalerts"><a id="MovingAverages" name="MovingAverages"></a>Viewing moving averages and alerts</h2>

  <p>In addition to the Investigate Anomalies checkbox, there are two checkboxes displayed for the
  APIs on the API Proxies page or for an API on its detail page.</p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Show Moving Averages</strong></td>

        <td>Check this checkbox to view a moving average for the API.  You can check this
        checkbox for multiple APIs to view a moving average that includes the set of these APIs. A
        moving average is a series of averages taken over sucessive subsets of a complete set of
        data. It's especially useful in viewing trends. The moving average is displayed as a band
        whose limits are +-20% of the calculated moving average data points.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Show Alerts</strong></td>

        <td>Select this checkbox (on the API Proxies page) to view the number of times that the
        moving average for the API exceeded the +-20% limit.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2 id="dispersion">Reading dispersion box plots</h2>

  <p>When an analytics report illustrates an average, as well as minimum and maximum values, we
  display an accompanying dispersion box plot, as called out in the custom report below.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/dispersionfull.png" width="700"></p>

  <p>At a glance, a dispersion box plot enables you to see the central tendency and dispersion of
  your data. A dispersion box plot surfaces the five key numbers when it comes to illustrating
  averaged analytics data:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/boxplot.png" width="200"></p>

  <p>In this example, the area within the box indicates the most typical average target response
  times experienced by your traffic &#8212; 50% of your traffic, to be exact.</p>

  <p>The line extending from the left side of the box indicates the average target response times
  experienced by 25% of your traffic.</p>

  <p>The line extending from the right of the box indicates the average target response times
  experienced by the remaining 25% of your traffic.</p>

  <p>The longer these lines, or &#8220;whiskers,&#8221; the more extreme your outlier values.</p>
