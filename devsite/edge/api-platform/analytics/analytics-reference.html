  <p>This topic is a reference for analytics metrics, dimensions, and filters. For more context on
  using these, see <a href="/api-platform/analytics/analytics-services-overview.html">Analytics
  Services overview</a>.</p>

  <p>This topic shows the names for metrics and dimensions as they appear in the UI and as you need
  to use them in API calls.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You'll see the UI names when you create <a href=
    "/api-platform/analytics/create-custom-reports.html" target="_blank">Custom Reports</a>.</li>

    <li>Use the API-specific names when <a href=

        <td>
          <p>Returns the number of elements in L1 (in-memory) cache per transaction over a given
          time period. For example, if you choose <code>max</code> for the period of a day, and
          within that day the highest number of elements in cache is 12 for a specific transaction,
          then the count will be 12. For <code>avg</code>, if there are three transactions in the
          time period you're querying, and their cache counts are 5, 6, and 7, the average is 6. L1
          cache is in-memory cache as opposed to L2 database cache, as described in <a href=
          "/api-platform/cache/cache-internals.html">Cache internals</a>.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>Policy Errors</td>

        <td>policy_error</td>

        <td>sum</td>

        <td>
          <p>The total number of policy errors over the specified time period.</p>

          <p>Policy errors usually occur by design. For example, the Verify API Key policy throws
          an error when an invalid API key is passed in the request, and a Spike Arrest policy
          throws an error if the number of API calls exceeds the limit defined in the policy. So
          this metric is useful for finding potential trouble spots in your APIs. For example,
          policy_error metrics, grouped by the developer_app dimension, might help you discover
          that an API key or OAuth token has expired for a given app; or you might find that a
          specific API proxy is throwing a lot of Spike Arrest errors, leading you to discover that
          the proxy's spike arrest limit doesn't account for an increase in holiday traffic.</p>

          <p>A policy error is logged in analytics only if the error results in API proxy failure.
          For example, if a policy's <code>continueOnError</code> attribute is set to
          <code>true</code>, the API proxy continues processing a request even if the policy fails.
          In that case, a policy error is not logged in analytics.</p>

          <p>The Policy Name on Error (ax_execution_fault_policy_name) dimension is useful for
          grouping policy errors by policy name.</p>

          <p>A target failure (such as a 404 or 503) does not count as a policy failure. Those
          count as API proxy failures (is_error).</p>

          failure can occur when a policy fails or when there's a runtime failure, such as a 404 or
          503 from the target service.</p>

          <p>The Proxy (apiproxy) dimension is useful for grouping API proxy failures by proxy.</p>

          <p>The total number of times a Response Cache policy was executed over the given time
          period.</p>

          <p>Since the Response Cache policy is attached in two places in an API proxy (once in the
          request and once in the response), it usually executes twice in an API call. A cache
          'get' and a cache 'put' each count as one execution.</p>

          <p>However, response cache execution is 0 if the <code><a href=
          "/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy.html#SkipCacheLookupElement"
          target="_blank">&lt;SkipCacheLookup&gt;</a></code> element in the policy evaluates to
          true (in the request), and 0 if the <code><a href=
          "/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy.html#SkipCachePopulationElement"
          target="_blank">&lt;SkipCachePopulation&gt;</a></code> element in the policy evaluates to
          true (in the response).</p>

          <p>In the <a href="/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html" target="_blank">Trace

          the target service response and ends when Apigee forwards the response to the original

          tells you how target servers are performing. The time starts when Edge forwards a request
          to the target service and ends when Edge receives the response.</p>

          <p>Note that if an API call returns a response from cache (using the Response Cache
          policy, for example), the call will never reach the target service, and no target
          response time metrics are logged.</p>

  <p>Dimensions let you view metrics in meaningful groupings. For example, seeing total traffic
