  <p>The Geo Map dashboard tracks traffic patterns, error patterns, and quality of service across
  geographical locations. You can view information about all your APIs, or zoom in on specific
  ones. This dashboard helps you assess:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>API growth trends</strong> - Use the Traffic metric to see where your
    traffic is coming from. By using different time periods you can see which countries generate
    the most traffic at which times. You can also record traffic rates over different time periods
    to see trends in growth. </li>

    <li><strong>Error trends</strong> - Use the Error Count metric to see where where API
    errors are coming from. By using different time periods you can see which countries generate
    the most errors at which times. You can also record error rates over different time periods to
    see trends in growth.</li>

    <li><strong>Quality of service</strong> - Use the Average Response
    Time and Average Target Response Time metrics to see how your backend services
    are performing by country.</li>
  </ul>

  dashboard?</h2>

  <p>Select a metric to measure from the <strong>Metric</strong> menu. Select an API proxy to
  measure from the <strong>API Proxy</strong> menu, or include all API proxies. </p>

  <p>Use the <strong>Traffic By Location</strong> menu to drill down on specific countries, states,
  and cities (depending on the specific geography of the country you are interested in). Any
  country for which metrics are recorded will appear in this menu. For example, you can look at
  United States data, then select a state, and then view a list of cities from which traffic is
  generated. City drilldown is currently available only for the United States and Canada.</p>

  <p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date selector, hovering over maps for more
  context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see
