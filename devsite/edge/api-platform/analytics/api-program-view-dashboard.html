  <h2 id="whatistheapigeeedgedashboard">What is the Apigee Edge dashboard?</h2>

  <p>The Apigee Edge dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in to Edge. It gives you a
  quick overall view of your API program -- patterns for API traffic, developer engagement, and
  developer apps. And, you can drill in on each chart for a more detailed view.</p>

  <p>This dashboard has three charts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proxy Traffic</strong> -- Plots overall traffic for all of the APIs in an
    organization. See at a glance the error rate as a percentage of total traffic.</li>

    <li><strong>Developer Engagement</strong> -- Gives a quick sense of how developers are engaged
    with your APIs.</li>

    <li><strong>Developer Apps</strong> -- Breaks down API traffic by developer app. Shows you
    which apps are receiving the most traffic. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can see this dashboard anytime by selecting <strong>Dashboard</strong> from the main
  Apigee Edge menu. For general information on using dashboards and exporting data, see
    <a href="/api-platform/analytics/using-analytics-dashboards.html">Using the analytics dashboards</a>. </p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The Apigee Edge dashboard is available only to users of Classic
  Edge. The dashboard is not currently available in the <a href="http://docs-new.apigee.com" target="_blank">New Edge experience</a>.</aside>

    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Proxy traffic</strong></td>

        <td>
          <p>All the API traffic for an organization over the selected period of time. Traffic,
          also called "throughput", represents the number of API requests and responses seen by an
          API organization. </p>

          <p>Click the <strong>Proxy Performance</strong> link to drill down to a more
          detailed view. </p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Developer Engagement</strong></td>

        <td>
          <p>Measures the average number of API calls for registered developers during
          the selected period of time.</p>

          <p>Shows you active and highly active developers (greater than 50 transactions per hour).
          Also shown are the total number of developers who have signed up to use your APIs.</p>

          <p>Click the <strong>Developer Engagement</strong> link to drill down to a more
          detailed view. </p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's possible that the Developer Engagement could reflect
          higher numbers for a Week timespan than for a Month. This is because engagement is
          calculated based on the average number of calls during a specific period of time
          (week/month). You could have a large number of developers register their apps, but for a
          period of time the apps are not generating traffic (perhaps because their apps are still
          in development). If traffic starts later, in the most recent week, then calculated
          engagement will be higher for the most recent week than over the previous month, because
          most of the traffic was generated in the most recent week. </p>
