  <h2 id="whatdoesthisdashboardtellme">What does this dashboard tell me?</h2>

  <p>The Error Code Analysis dashboard tells you about error rates for API proxies and targets.
    The Error Code Analysis dashboard uses:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The response code to calculate proxy errors</p></li>
      <li><p>The target response code to calculate target errors</p></li>
    </ul>

  <p>Errors reported on the Error Code Analysis dashboard might be different from errors reported
    on the API Proxy Performance dashboard because that dashboard calculates error rates based on
    the <code>is_error</code> flow variable. That variable can be explicitly set by the API proxy,
    so it is not related to the error codes in the proxy response or target response.</p>

  <p>When calculating error rates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A proxy can handle a target error and still return a success response. In this case,
      the error is counted as a target error but not as a proxy error.</p></li>
      <li><p>When the target response is either success or does not exist, but the proxy responded
      with an error, the error is counted against the proxy. </p></li>
      <li><p>If both the proxy and target respond with an error, the error is counted on the target.</p></li>
    </ul>

  dashboard?</h2>

  <p>You can view metrics for all proxies or drill into specific proxies using the <strong>Proxy
  Dimension</strong> dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard.</p>

  <p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering
  over graphs for more context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see
