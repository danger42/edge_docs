  <p>You can view metrics for all proxies or drill into specific proxies using the <strong>Target
  IP</strong> dimension dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard.</p>

  <p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering
  over graphs for more context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see
