  <p>The Apigee Edge Analytics Services API lets you monitor and manage API performance and health.
  The Analytics Services API is a valuable tool that you can use to troubleshoot problems. For
  example, if your API goes down, analytics charts can help illustrate whether the failure was
  sudden or involved a slow lead-in time. If your API is slowing down, simulated transactions can
  help you determine how and where the bottlenecks are. In addition, analytics can help you
  diagnose usage problems, such as a sudden spike in traffic or the opposite, a sudden decrease in
  traffic. </p>
