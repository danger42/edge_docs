  <h2 id="whatdoesthisdashboardtellme">What does this dashboard tell me?</h2>

  <p>The Business Transactions Dashboard lets you monitor and visually compare traffic for specific
  API patterns across multiple API proxies. This information helps you understand changes in API
  traffic that might be caused by specific business, marketing, or partner events.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose that your marketing team hosts a program that drives customers to a
  specific site. The URI pattern for that site will experience an increase in traffic, giving the
  team a way to measure the impact of the program in real time.   <br>

<h2>How do I set up this dashboard?</h2>
<p>The Business Transactions dashboard requires the following setup steps:</p>
<ol>
        <li>In the API Management menu, select <b>API Proxies</b> from the <strong>APIs</strong> menu.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>In the API Proxies page, select the proxy you wish to measure.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>On the far right, select the Performance tab. You will the data comparing the various proxies and URI Patterns. To set the URI patterns to compare, click the "Compare" button on the left-hand side of the page. From there, you can manage the patterns to compare. To add a pattern, click&nbsp;<strong>+Pattern</strong>. To remove a pattern, click the X associated to that pattern. For more details on configuring URI Patterns, see&nbsp;"<a href="#monitoring">Monitoring the performance of individual URIs in an API proxy</a>".</li>
        <li>After adding a pattern, click the checkmark button to add the pattern.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>From the Analytics menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Business Transaction Dashboard</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click the configuration (gear) icon next to the Business Transactions heading. The URI patterns for all APIs in your organization are listed there.</li>
        <li>Select the URI patterns you wish to compare and specify a date range.</li>
        <li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add URI patterns from as many APIs as you wish.</p>
<h2><a id="monitoring" name="monitoring"></a>Monitoring the performance of individual URIs in an API proxy</h2>
<p>Patterns are compared to the <em>path suffix</em>. They should begin with a forward slash and can include the asterisk (*) wildcard to match a path segment.</p>
<p>For example, given a proxy base path of /v1/inventory and resource paths of:</p>
<ul>
        <li>/1</li>
        <li>/abc/123</li>
        <li>/abc/123/xyz</li>
        <li>/abc/456/dec</li>
</ul>
<p>...the full URL paths the clients use will be /v1/inventory/1 or /v1/inventory/abc/123/dec and so on. You will specify patterns to match only the path suffix, or resource paths. For example, you can specify these as patterns:</p>
<ul>
        <li>/1 - Collects metrics on the /1 URI</li>
        <li>/abc/123/* - Collects metrics on any URI beginning with /abc/123, with a following segment</li>
        <li>/abc/*/dec - Collects metrics on the /abc/123/dec and /abc/456/dec URIs <img src="/images/Performance_0.png" style="margin: 15px; padding: 0px; height: 201px; border: 1px solid; vertical-align: middle; width: 650px;" /></li>
</ul>
