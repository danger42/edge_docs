  <p>The Cache Performance dashboard lets you see at a glance the value of your Apigee Edge cache.
  The dashboard helps you visualize the benefit of the cache in terms of lower latency and reduced
  load backend servers. </p>

  <p>For information about cache management, see <a href= "/api-platform/cache/manage-caches-environment.html">Creating and editing an environment cache</a>.<br>

  <h2 id="whatelsedoineedtoknowaboutthisdashboard">What else do I need to know about this
  dashboard?</h2>

  <p>You can measure cache performance for all API proxies in your organization, or you can select
  individual ones. </p>

  <p>This dashboard uses standard controls, like the date and data aggregation selectors, hovering
  over graphs for more context, exporting data to CSV, and so on. To learn more, see
    <a href="/api-platform/analytics/using-analytics-dashboards.html">Using the analytics dashboards</a>.</p>
