  <p>This topic offers a basic overview of OAuth 2.0 on Apigee Edge. </p>

  <h2 id="whatisoauth20">What is OAuth 2.0?</h2>

  <p>There are many books, blogs, and sites devoted to OAuth 2.0. We highly recommend that you
  begin by reviewing the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">IETF OAuth 2.0
  specification</a>. Here's the definition of OAuth 2.0 from the OAuth 2.0 IETF specification
  itself:</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
  application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by
  orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by
  allowing the  third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf."</p>

  <p>The main thing you need to know is that OAuth 2.0 provides a way for apps to gain <a href=
  "#scopes">limited access</a> to a user's protected resources (think of bank account or any other
  sensitive information a user might wish to access from an app) without the need for the user to
  divulge their login credentials to the app. </p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> Let's say you found an app that lets you access multiple
  bank accounts. Maybe the app is used to help with your taxes, or for managing your budget. You
  have three bank accounts that you want to manage with the app, and you have a different username
  and password for each one. Now, for the app to access your bank accounts, it needs those
  sensitive credentials. Basically, you're giving this sensitive information to the app. Do you
  trust the app to possess your passwords and usernames? What if the app is hacked? Now, you've got
  to remember to change your bank credentials for each account. This is the fundamental
  problem that OAuth 2.0 solves. Read on to learn how.</aside>

  <h2 id="theoauth20flow">The OAuth 2.0 flow</h2>

  <p>Here is the general flow for the OAuth 2.0 security framework. We'll discuss this flow in more
  detail in this topic, starting with a diagram, which illustrates a lot about how OAuth 2.0 works.
  If you're unfamiliar with the terms used in this diagram, read this section for a quick
  introduction. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/oauth-abstract.png"></p>

  <h3 id="theoauth20flow-termsyoushouldknow">Terms you should know</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Client:</strong> Also called "the app". It can be an app running on a mobile
    device or a traditional web app. The app makes requests to the resource server for protected
    assets on behalf of the resource owner. The resource owner must give the app permission to
    access the protected resources. </li>

    <li><strong>Resource owner:</strong> Also called an "end user". This is generally the
    person (or other entity) who is capable of granting access to a protected resource. For
    example, if an app needs to use data from one of your social media sites, then you are the
    resource owner -- the only person who can grant the app access to your data.</li>

    <li><strong>Resource server:</strong> Think of the resource server as a service like
    Facebook, Google, or Twitter; or an HR service on your intranet; or a partner service on your
    B2B extranet. Apigee Edge is a resource server whenever OAuth token validation is required to
    process API requests. The resource server needs some kind of authorization before it will serve
    up protected resources to the app. </li>

    <li><strong>Authorization server:</strong> The authorization server is implemented
    in compliance with the OAuth 2.0 specification, and it is responsible for
    validating <strong>authorization grants</strong> and issuing the <strong>access
    tokens </strong>that give the app access to the user's data on the resource server. You
    can configure "token endpoints" on Apigee Edge, in which case Edge takes on the role of
    authorization server. </li>

    <li><strong>Authorization grant:</strong> Gives the app permission to retrieve an access
    token on behalf of the end user. OAuth 2.0 defines four specific "grant types". See "<a href=
    "#granttypes">What are the OAuth 2.0 grant types</a>" below. </li>

    <li><strong>Access token:</strong> A long string of characters that serves as a credential
    used to access protected resources. See also "<a href="#accesstoken">What is an access
    token?</a>" below. </li>

    <li><strong>Protected resource:</strong> Data owned by the resource owner. For example, the
    user's contact list, account information, or other sensitive data. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="whereapigeeedgefitsin">Where Apigee Edge fits in</h2>

  <p>You can protect any API proxied through Apigee Edge with OAuth 2.0. Edge includes an
  authorization server implementation, and as such, can generate and validate access tokens.
  Developers begin by <a href="#registering">registering their apps</a> with Apigee Edge.
  Registered apps can request access tokens through any of the four <a href="#granttypes">grant
  type</a> interactions.</p>

  <p>Apigee provides a multi-faceted <strong>OAuthV2 policy</strong> that implements the
  details of each grant type, making it relatively easy to set up OAuth on Apigee Edge. For
  example, you can configure a policy that receives a request for an access token, evaluates all
  required credentials, and returns an access token if the credentials are valid. </p>
  <!-- Pending tutorial update <p>If you want to see how it fits together, check out the <a href="/node/8399.html">8399</a> end-to-end tutorial</a>. The tutorial steps through the process of configuring the OAuth 2.0 policy, requesting an access token, and calling a protected API.&nbsp;</p>-->

  <p>Note that any resource servers that your secure API proxy calls should be behind a firewall
  (that is, the resources must not be accessible through any means besides the API proxy or another
  API that is well secured).</p>

  <h2 id="whatareoauth20granttypes"><a id="granttypes" name="granttypes"></a>What are OAuth 2.0
  grant types?</h2>

  <p>Think of grant types as different paths or interactions an app can take to gain an access
  token. Each grant type addresses one or more use cases, and you'll need to select which grant
  type(s) to use based on your own needs. In general, each grant type has advantages and
  disadvantages, and you'll need to weigh the tradeoffs based on your business use cases. One
  important consideration is the "trustworthiness" of the apps that will be accessing your data.
  Generally, third-party apps are less trustworthy than apps that are developed and used within an
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>Apigee Edge supports the four main OAuth 2.0 grant types:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>authorization code</strong> -- Considered the most secure grant type. Before the
    authorization server issues an access token, the app must first receive an authorization code
    from the resource server. You've seen this flow anytime your app opens a browser to the
    resource server's login page and invites you log in to your actual account (for example,
    Facebook or Twitter).</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you successfully log in, the app will receive an authorization
  code that it can use to negotiate an access token with the authorization server. Typically, this
  grant type is used when the app resides on a server rather than on the client. This grant type is
  considered highly secure because the client app never handles or sees the user's username or
  password for the resource server (that is, for example, the app never sees or handles your
  Twitter credentials). This grant type flow is also called "three-legged" OAuth.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>implicit</strong> -- Considered a simplified version of authorization code.
    Typically this grant type is used when the app resides on the client. For example, the app's
    code is implemented in a browser using JavaScript or another scripting language (instead of
    residing and running on a separate web server). In this grant type flow, the authorization
    server returns an access token directly when the user is authenticated, rather than issuing an
    authorization code first. Implicit grants can improve app responsiveness in some cases, but
    this advantage needs to be weighed against possible security implications as described in the
    IETF specification. </li>

    <li><strong>resource owner password credentials</strong> -- In this flow, the client is issued
    an access token when the user's username/password are validated by the authorization server.
    This flow is recommended for highly trusted applications. An advantage of this flow over, say,
    basic authentication, is that the user only presents their username/password once. From then
    on, the access token is used. </li>

    <li><strong>client credentials</strong> -- Consider using for situations where the client
    app is acting on its own behalf. That is, the client is also the resource owner. This grant
    type is typically used when the app needs to access a backend data storage service, for
    example. The app needs to use the service to do its work, and the service is otherwise opaque
    to the end user. With this grant type, an app can receive an access token by presenting it's
    client ID and client secret keys to the authorization server. No further steps are required.
    Edge provides an out-of-the-box client credentials solution that's easy to implement for any
    API proxy. <span style="font-size: 12px;"> </span></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="whatisanaccesstoken"><a id="accesstoken" name="accesstoken"></a>What is an access
  token?</h2>

  <p>An access token is a long string of characters that serves as a credential used to access
  protected resources. Resources tokens (also called bearer tokens) are passed in Authorization
  headers, like this:</p>
  <pre class="terminal prettyprint prettyprinted">
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer UAj2yiGAcMZGxfN2DhcUbl9v8WsR" \
  http://myorg-test.apigee.net/v0/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282
</pre>

  <p>The resource server understands that the access token "stands in" for credentials like
  username and password. In addition, the access tokens can be issued with restrictions, so that,
  for example, the app can read but not write or delete data on the resource server. Note that an
  access token can be revoked if, for instance, the app is compromised. In this case, you will need
  to get a new access token to continue using the app; however, you will not have to change your
  username or password on the protected resources server (for example, Facebook or
  Twitter). </p>

  <p>Access tokens generally have an expiration (for security reasons). Some grant types allow the
  authorization server to issue an refresh token, which allows the app to fetch a new access token
  when the old one expires. For more details on access and refresh tokens, refer to the IETF OAuth
  2.0 specification. </p>

  <h2 id="limitedaccessthroughscopes"><a id="scopes" name="scopes"></a>Limited access through
  scopes</h2>

  <p>Through the mechanism of scopes, OAuth 2.0 can grant an app limited access to protected
  resources. For example, an app may have access only to specific resources, may be able to update
  resources, or may only be granted read-only access. Under so-called "three-legged" OAuth flows,
  the user typically specifies the level of access through a consent page (for example, a web page
  where the user selects the scope with a checkbox of other mechanism). </p>

  <h2 id="registeringanapp"><a id="registering" name="registering"></a>Registering an app</h2>

  <p>All clients (apps) must register with the OAuth 2.0 authorization server from which they
  intend to request access tokens. When you register an app, you receive back a set of keys. One is
  a public key called the client identifier, and the other is a secret key called the client
  secret. Without these keys, an app cannot issue requests for authorization codes or access tokens
  to the authorization server. Note that while the IETF OAuth specification calls these keys client
  ID and client secret, the Apigee Edge UI calls them the Consumer ID and Consumer secret. They are
  equivalent. </p>

  <h2 id="summaryofoauth20usecases">Summary of OAuth 2.0 use cases</h2>

  <p>Which OAuth 2.0 grant type flow you chose to implement depends on your specific use case, as
  some grant types are more secure than others. Your choice of grant types depends on the
  trustworthiness of the client app and requires very careful consideration, as described in the
  following table:</p>

  <h2 id="oauth20vsapikeysecurity"><a id="apikey" name="apikey"></a>OAuth 2.0 vs. API key
  security</h2>

  <p>API key validation requires an app to send a key to Edge. The key must be a valid consumer key
  from an Apigee Edge developer app that is associated with the API proxy. If for some reason you
  need to revoke permission for a client app to make calls to a proxy, you must revoke that
  consumer key. Any client apps using that key will also be unable to access the API proxy. On the
  other hand, an OAuth token can be revoked at any time without revoking the app's keys. The app
  can simply request a new token on behalf of the user, and if a token is granted, the app can
  continue using the API proxy. </p>

  <p>Another difference between an API key and a token is that a token can include metadata
  attributes that you can retrieve and use later. For example, you might store the ID of the user
  making the API call and use it to customize calls to the backend target service.</p>
