  <p>As an app developer, you need to include an access token in any request to Apigee Edge for a
  protected resource (an API that is protected with a VerifyAccessToken policy). Note that access
  tokens are also called "bearer tokens." </p>

  <h2 id="sendinganaccesstokeninarequest">Sending an access token in a request</h2>

  <p>When you put a VerifyAccessToken policy at the front of your API proxy flow, apps must present
  a verifiable <strong>access token</strong> (also called a "bearer token") to consume
  your API. To do this, the app sends the access token in the request as
  an <strong>"Authorization" HTTP header</strong>.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ylSkZIjbdWybfs4fUQe9BqP0LH5Z" http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282
</pre>

  <p>Apigee Edge will verify that the access token presented is valid, and then grant access to the
  API, returning the response to the app that made the request.</p>
