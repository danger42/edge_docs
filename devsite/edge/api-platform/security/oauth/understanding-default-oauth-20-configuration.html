  {% block body %}

  <p>If you are using the Apigee Cloud version of Edge, then you will see that a proxy called
  <strong>oauth</strong> is included in your organization by default. This proxy provides two
  sample endpoints for generating access and refresh tokens. If you'd like to learn more about
  OAuth token endpoints, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/oauth/configuring-oauth-endpoints-and-policies.html">Understanding OAuth
  endpoints</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> This proxy is <strong>not</strong> provisioned by default in
  Apigee Private Cloud installations of Edge. If you are on a Private Cloud, or if you do not see
  the oauth proxy in your org for any reason, a copy of it is maintained in the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/default-proxies">api-platform-samples
  repo in GitHub</a>. The README has instructions for deploying the proxy.</aside>

  <p>The client credentials grant type defines a procedure for issuing access tokens in exchange
  for <strong>app credentials</strong>. These app credentials are the consumer key and secret
  pair that Apigee Edge issues for each app that is registered in an organization. For more
  details, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/oauth/oauth-v2-policy-authorization-code-grant-type.html">Implementing
  the authorization code grant type</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="addoauth20toanewapiproxy">Add OAuth 2.0 to a new API proxy</h2>

  <p>You can easily add OAuth verification to an API when you create a new API proxy.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your Apigee Edge account.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>APIs &gt; API Proxies</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>+ API Proxy</strong>.</li>

    <li>Use the wizard to create a Reverse proxy. If you're not familiar with this dialog, see
    <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/build-simple-api-proxy.html">Build a simple API
    proxy</a>.</li>

    <li>In the Security section of the wizard, select the radio button next to <strong>OAuth
    v2.0</strong>. </li>
  </ol>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When you select this option, two policies will be attached to the
  newly created API proxy, one to verify access tokens and another to strip the access token after
  it has been verified.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Note that the <strong>Publish API
  Product</strong> checkbox becomes selectable and is automatically selected. Check this if
  you want to automatically generate a product when you build the new API proxy. The autogenerated
  product will be created with an association to the new API proxy. If you have an existing product
  with which you want to associate this new API, be sure to clear this checkbox so that you don't
  create an unnecessary product. For information about products, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/what-api-product.html">What is an API product?</a></p>

  <h2 id="workingwiththedefaultoauthproxy">Working with the default OAuth proxy</h2>

  <p>The oauth proxy exposes the following endpoint URI:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken
</pre>

  <p>Publish this URI to developers who need to obtain access tokens. App developers configure
  their apps to call this endpoint, presenting their consumer key and secret pairs to obtain access
  tokens.</p>

  <p>The default client credentials token endpoint is exposed over the network at the following
  URL:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://{org_name}-{env_name}.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken
</pre>

  <p>For example, if your organization name is "apimakers", the URL would be:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
https://apimakers-test.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken
</pre>

  <p>This is the URL that developers call to obtain access tokens.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> By default, out-of-the-box OAuth endpoints are only deployed
  in the test environment. Before they are available in prod, you must explicitly deploy the API
  proxy called <code>oauth</code> to <code>prod</code>.</aside>

  <h2 id="calltheapi">Call the API</h2>

  <p>When you get back an access token, you can call the API with an Authorization header and
  Bearer token, like this:</p>

  <p><code>curl -H "Authorization: Bearer &lt;your access token&gt;"
  http://myorg-myenv.apigee.net/myapi </code></p>

  tokens</a>.</p>{% endblock %}
