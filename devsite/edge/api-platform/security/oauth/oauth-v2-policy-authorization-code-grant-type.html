  <p>Authorization code is one of the most commonly used OAuth 2.0 grant types. The authorization
  code flow is a "three-legged OAuth" configuration. In this configuration, the user authenticates
  himself with the resource server and gives the app consent to access their protected resources
  without divulging username/passwords to the client app. </p>

  <h2 id="aboutthistopic">About this topic</h2>

  <p>This topic offers a general description and overview of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant type
  flow and discusses how to implement this flow on Apigee Edge.</p>

  <h2 id="usecases">Use cases</h2>

  <p>This grant type is intended for apps that are written by third-party developers who do not
  have a trusted business relationship with the API provider. For example, developers who register
  for public API programs should not generally be trusted. With this grant type, the user's
  credentials on the resource server are never shared with the app. </p>

  <h2 id="codesample">Code sample</h2>

  <p>You can find a complete, working sample implementation of the authorization code grant type on
  Apigee Edge in the <code>api-platform-samples</code> repo on GitHub. See the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/sample-proxies/oauth-advanced">oauth-advanced
  sample</a> in the api-platform-samples/sample-proxies directory. See the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/sample-proxies/oauth-advanced/README.md">
  README</a> file for details on the sample. </p>

  <h2 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow">Steps in the authorization code flow</h2>

  <p>Here is a summary of the steps required to implement the authorization code grant type where
  Apigee Edge serves as the authorization server. Remember, the key to this flow is that the client
  never gets to see the user's credentials on the resource server.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The illustrations below are taken from the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/sample-proxies/oauth-advanced">authorization
  code sample implementation</a> on GitHub.</aside>

  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The client app must be registered with Apigee Edge to
  obtain the client ID and client secret keys. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/registering-client-apps.html">Registering client apps</a> for
  details.</p>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-1userinitiatestheflow">1. User initiates the flow</h3>

  <p>When the app needs to access the user's protected resources from a resource server (for
  example, contacts list on a social media site), it sends an API call to Apigee Edge, which
  validates the client's ID and, if it's valid, redirects the user's browser to a login page where
  the user will enter their credentials. The API call includes information the client app
  obtained when it was registered: the client ID and redirect URI.</p>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-2userenterscredentials">2. User enters credentials</h3>

  <p>The user now sees a login page where they are asked to enter their login credentials. If the
  login is successful, we go to the next step. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/oauth-login-page.png"></p>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-3usergivesconsent">3. User gives consent</h3>

  <p>In this step, the user gives the app consent to access their resources. The consent form
  typically includes scope selections, where the user can choose what the app is permitted to do on
  the resource server. For example, the user may give read-only permission, or permission for
  the app to update resources.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/oauth-consent-page.png"></p>

  

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-4theloginappsendsarequestapigeeedge">4. The login app
  sends a request Apigee Edge</h3>

  <p>If the login and consent are successful, the login app POSTs data to the /authorizationcode
  endpoint of Apigee Edge. The data includes the redirect URI, client ID, scope, any user-specific
  information it wishes to include, and an indication that the login was successful.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> It is important to note that the client app never sees this
  information. It is handled server-side and negotiated between the login app and Apigee Edge. For
  an example that shows how this step is handled securely, refer to the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/sample-proxies/oauth-advanced">authorization
  code sample implementation</a> on GitHub. </aside>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-5apigeeedgegeneratesanauthorizationcode">5. Apigee Edge
  generates an authorization code</h3>

  <p>When Edge receives a GET request from the login app on its /authorizationcode endpoint, two
  things happen. First, Edge determines that the login was successful (by checking HTTP status or
  some other means). Next Edge checks to be sure that the redirect URI sent from the login app
  matches the redirect URI that was specified when the app was registered with Apigee Edge. If
  everything is okay, Edge generates an authorization code. For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
http://myorg-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorizationcode?client_id={consumer_key}&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&amp;scope=scope1%20scope2&amp;state={some_string}
</pre>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-6edgesendstheauthorizationcodebacktotheclient">6. Edge
  sends the authorization code back to the client</h3>

  <p>Edge sends a 302 redirect with the auth code attached as a query parameter to the
  client. </p>

  <h3 id=
  "stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-7theclientretrievestheauthorizationcodeandrequestsanaccesscodefromedge">
  7. The client retrieves the authorization code and requests an access code from Edge</h3>

  <p>Now with a valid auth code, the client can request an access token from Edge. It does this by
  POSTing the client ID and client secret keys (obtained when the app was registered on Edge), the
  grant type, and scope. By including the client ID and secret keys Apigee Edge can verify
  that the client app is the one that was registered. For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl https://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/my_oauth_proxy/accesstoken?code=Xyz123&amp;grant_type=authorization_code -X POST -d 'client_id=bBGAQrXgivA9lKu7NMPyoYpKNhGar6K&amp;client_secret=hAr4GngA9vAyvI4'
</pre>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-8theclientreceivesanaccesstoken">8. The client receives
  an access token</h3>

  <p>If everything is successful, Edge returns an access token to the client. The access token will
  have an expiration, and it will be valid only for the scope specified by the user when they gave
  consent to the app to access their resources.</p>

  <h3 id="stepsintheauthorizationcodeflow-9theclientcallstheprotectedapi">9. The client calls the
  protected API</h3>

  <p>Now, with a valid access code, the client can make calls to the protected API. In this
  scenario, requests are made to Apigee Edge (the proxy), and Edge is responsible for validating
  the access token before passing the API call along to the target resource server. Access tokens
  are passed in an Authorization header. For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ylSkZIjbdWybfs4fUQe9BqP0LH5Z" http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282
</pre>

  <h2 id="configuringflowsandpolicies">Configuring flows and policies</h2>

  <p>As the authorization server, Edge needs to process a number of OAuth requests: for access
  tokens, auth codes, refresh tokens, login page redirects, etc. There are two fundamental steps to
  configure these endpoints:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Creating custom flows</li>

    <li>Adding and configuring OAuthV2 policies</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="configuringflowsandpolicies-customflowconfiguration"><a id="flowconfig" name=
  "flowconfig"></a>Custom flow configuration</h3>

  <p>You typically configure this grant type flow so that each step or "leg" of the flow is defined
  by a flow in the Apigee Edge proxy. Each flow has an endpoint and a policy that performs the
  OAuth-specific task required, such as generating an authorization code or an access token. For
  example, as shown in the XML below, the <code>/oauth/authorizationcode</code> endpoint has an
  associated policy called GenerateAuthCode (which is an OAuthV2 policy with the
  GenerateAuthorizationCode operation specified). </p>

  <p>The easiest way to show the flow configuration is with an XML example. See the in-line
  comments for information about each flow. This is an example -- names of flows and paths can
  be configured however you wish. See also <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/oauth/configuring-oauth-endpoints-and-policies.html">Configuring OAuth
  endpoints and policies</a> for a quick overview of the steps needed to create a custom flow
  like this.</p>

</pre>

  <h3 id="configuringflowsandpolicies-configuretheflowswithpolicies"><a id="Example" name=
  "Example"></a>Configure the flows with policies</h3>

  <p>Each endpoint has a policy associated with it. Let's see examples of the policies. See
  also <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/oauth/configuring-oauth-endpoints-and-policies.html">Configuring OAuth
  endpoints and policies</a> for a quick overview of the steps needed to add OAuthV2 policies
  to proxy endpoints.</p>

  <h4>Login redirect </h4>

  <p>This is the <code>/oauth/authorize</code> path. The attached policy is responsible for
  redirecting the user to a login app, where the end user can safely authenticate and authorize the
  client app to access their protected resources without divulging their username and password to
  the client app. You can accomplish this with a service callout policy, JavaScript, Node.js, or
  other means.</p>

  <p>The API call to do the request is a GET and requires the query parameters client_id,
  response_type, redirect_uri, scope, and state.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl http://myorg-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorize?client_id={consumer_key}&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&amp;scope=scope1%20scope2&amp;state={some_string}
</pre>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Best practice:</b> The login app typically POSTs a redirect response
  back to Apigee Edge. Edge then directs the user's browser to the registered callback URL. It's a
  best practice not to send the response directly back to the user agent/client to avoid exposing
  sensitive information. </aside>

  <h4>Get auth code</h4>

  <p>This is the <code>/oauth/authorizationcode</code> path. It uses the OAuthV2 policy with the
  GenerateAuthorizationCode operation specified.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;OAuthV2 async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="GetAuthCode"&gt;
    &lt;DisplayName&gt;GetAuthCode&lt;/DisplayName&gt;
    &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAuthorizationCode&lt;/Operation&gt;
    &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;600000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt;
    &lt;GenerateResponse/&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The API call to obtain the authorization code is a GET and requires the query parameters
  client_id, response_type, and optionally scope and state, as shown in this example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$curl http://myorg-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorizationcode?client_id={consumer_key}&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=scope1%20scope2&amp;state={some_string}
</pre>

  <h4>Get access token</h4>

  <p>This policy is attached to the <code>/oauth/accesstoken</code> path. It uses the OAuthV2
  policy with the GenerateAccessCode operation specified. In this case, the grant_type parameter is
  expected as a query param:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;OAuthV2 name="GetAccessToken"&gt;
    &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt;
    &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;360000000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt; 
    &lt;SupportedGrantTypes&gt; 
        &lt;GrantType&gt;authorization_code&lt;/GrantType&gt; 
    &lt;/SupportedGrantTypes&gt; 
    &lt;GrantType&gt;request.queryparam.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt; 
    &lt;GenerateResponse/&gt; 
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The API call to obtain the access code is a POST and must include the client_id,
  client_secret, grant_type=authorization_code, and, optionally, scope. For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl https://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/oauth/accesstoken?grant_type=authorization_code -X POST -d 'client_id=bBGAQrXgivA9lKu7NMPyoYpVKNhGar6K&amp;client_secret=hAr4Gn0gA9vAyvI4'
</pre>

  <p>This is just a basic summary. A production example includes many other policies for building
  up URLs, doing transformations, and performing other tasks. Refer to the sample on GitHub for a
  complete, working project.</p>

  <h2 id="attachingtheverifyaccesstokenpolicy">Attaching the verify access token policy</h2>

  <p>Attach a VerifyAccessToken policy (OAuthV2 policy with the VerifyAccessToken operation
  specified) to the beginning of any flow that accesses a protected API, so that it is executed
  whenever a request for a protected resources comes in. Edge checks to be sure each request has a
  valid access token. If not, an error is returned. For the basic steps, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/oauth/using-access-tokens.html">Verifying access tokens</a>. </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;OAuthV2 async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="VerifyAccessToken"&gt;
    &lt;DisplayName&gt;VerifyAccessToken&lt;/DisplayName&gt;
    &lt;ExternalAuthorization&gt;false&lt;/ExternalAuthorization&gt;
    &lt;Operation&gt;VerifyAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt;
    &lt;SupportedGrantTypes/&gt;
    &lt;GenerateResponse enabled="true"/&gt;
    &lt;Tokens/&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;
</pre>

  <h2 id="callingtheprotectedapi">Calling the protected API</h2>

  <p>To call an API that is protected with OAuth 2.0 security, you need to present a valid access
  token. The correct pattern is to include the token in an Authorization header, as follows: Note
  that the access token is also referred to as a "bearer token". </p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer UAj2yiGAcMZGxfN2DhcUbl9v8WsR" \
  http://myorg-test.apigee.net/v0/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282
