  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">Security
  Assertion Markup Language (SAML)</a> specification defines formats and protocols that enable
  applications to exchange XML-formatted information for authentication and authorization.</p>

  <p>Edge API Services enables you to authenticate and authorize apps that are capable of
  presenting SAML tokens. A SAML token is a digitally signed fragment of XML that presents a set of
  "assertions". These assertions can be used to enforce authentication and authorization.</p>

  <p>To use SAML terminology, API Services can function as a service provider (SP) or an Identity
  Provider (IDP). When API Services validates SAML tokens on inbound requests from apps, it acts in
  the role of SP. (API Services can also act in the IDP role, when generating SAML tokens to be used
  when communicating with backend services. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/security/last-mile-security.html">Last-mile security</a>).</p>

  <p>The SAML policy type enables API proxies to validate SAML assertions that are attached to
  inbound SOAP requests. The SAML policy validates incoming messages that contain a
  digitally-signed SAML assertion, rejects them if they are invalid, and sets variables that allow
  additional policies, or the backend services itself, to further validate the information in the
  assertion.</p>

  <p>To validate SAML tokens, you need to make digital certificates available to the SAML policy by
  creating at least one TrustStore. TrustStores are scoped to environments in your organizations.
  Thus, you can configure different trust chains in test and prod, ensuring that test SAML tokens
  cannot be used in prod, and vice-versa.</p>
