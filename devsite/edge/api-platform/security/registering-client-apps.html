  <p>To participate in OAuth 2.0 flows on Apigee Edge, client apps must be registered. </p>

  <h2 id="whatisregistration">What is registration?</h2>

  <p>Registration allows Apigee Edge (the authorization server) to uniquely identify your app. When
  you register your app, you receive back two keys: a client ID and client secret. The app needs
  these keys when negotiating for access tokens with the authorization server.</p>

  <h2 id="quicksteps">Quick steps</h2>

  <p>For development and testing, you can use one of the pre-registered developer apps to obtain
  keys. See <a href="/api-platform/security/oauth/obtaining-developer-keys.html">Obtaining client
  credentials</a> for details. </p>

  <p>If you want to register a new app:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your Apigee Edge account.</li>

    <li>From the main menu, select <strong>Publish &gt; Developer apps</strong>. </li>

    <li>Click <strong>+ Developer App</strong>. </li>

    <li>Fill out the form:

      <ol>
        <li>Enter a name.</li>

        <li>Select a developer (you can choose one of the default developers or <a href=
        "/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product.html">create your
        own</a>). </li>

        <li>(Optional) Enter a callback URL. This is used for "three-legged" OAuth grant type
        flows. This is where Apigee Edge redirects the user after they complete authentication
        (login) with the resource server. It has to be a complete URL, so you might enter something
        like <code>https://www.example.com</code>. For more about three-legged OAuth, see
        <a href=
        "/api-platform/security/oauth/oauth-v2-policy-authorization-code-grant-type.html">Implementing
        the authorization code grant type</a>.</li>

        <li>Add a product. You can select one of the default products (or any product you wish). Or
        <a href="/api-platform/publish/create-api-products.html">create your own</a>. </li>

        <li>Ignore custom attributes for now.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Find your new app in the list of developer apps and select it.</li>

    <li>Now, you can click <strong>Show</strong> to see the Consumer ID (client ID) and Consumer
    Secret (client secret) values. </li>
  </ol>
