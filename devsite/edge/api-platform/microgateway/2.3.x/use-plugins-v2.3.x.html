  <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

  <p>This topic is intended for Edge Microgateway operators who wish to use existing plugins that
  are installed with the microgateway. It also discusses the spike arrest and quota plugins in
  detail (both are included with the installation). If you're a developer who wants to develop new
  plugins, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/microgateway/2.3.x/develop-custom-plugins-v2.3.x.html">Develop custom
  plugins</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="whatisanedgemicrogatewayplugin">What is an Edge Microgateway plugin?</h2>

  <p>A plugin is a Node.js module that adds functionality to Edge Microgateway. Plugin modules
  follow a consistent pattern and are stored in a location known to Edge Microgateway, enabling the
  microgateway to discover and load them automatically. Edge Microgateway includes several existing
  plugins and you can also create custom plugins, as explained in <a href=
  "/api-platform/microgateway/2.3.x/develop-custom-plugins-v2.3.x.html">Develop custom
  plugins</a>.</p>

    <li><strong>timeUnit</strong>: How often the spike arrest execution window resets. Valid values
    are second or minute.</li>

    <li><strong>allow</strong>: The maximum number of requests to allow during the timeUnit.</li>

    <li><strong>bufferSize</strong>: (optional, default = 0) if bufferSize &gt; 0, spike arrest
    stores this number of requests in a buffer. As soon as the next execution "window" occurs, the
    buffered requests will be processed first. See also<a href="#Adding%20a%20buffer"> Adding
    a buffer</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="usingthespikearrestplugin-howdoesspikearrestwork">How does spike arrest work?</h3>

  <p>Think of spike arrest as a way to generally protect against traffic spikes rather than as a
  way to limit traffic to a specific number of requests. Your APIs and backend can handle a certain
  amount of traffic, and the spike arrest policy helps you smooth traffic to the general amounts
  you want.</p>

  <p>The runtime spike arrest behavior differs from what you might expect to see from the literal
  per-minute or per-second values you enter.</p>

  <p>For example, say you specify a rate of 30 requests per minute, like this:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
spikearrest:
   timeUnit: minute
   allow: 30
</pre>

  <p>In testing, you might think you could send 30 requests in 1 second, as long as they came
  within a minute. But that's not how the policy enforces the setting. If you think about it, 30
  requests inside a 1-second period could be considered a mini spike in some environments.</p>

  <p>What actually happens, then? To prevent spike-like behavior, spike arrest smooths the allowed
  traffic by dividing your settings into smaller intervals, as follows:</p>

  <h4>Per-minute rates</h4>

  <p>Per-minute rates get smoothed into requests allowed intervals of seconds. For example, 30
  requests per minute gets smoothed like this:</p>

  <p>60 seconds (1 minute) / 30 = 2-second intervals, or about 1 request allowed every 2 seconds. A
  second request inside of 2 seconds will fail. Also, a 31st request within a minute will fail.</p>

  <h4>Per-second rates</h4>

  <p>Per-second rates get smoothed into requests allowed in intervals of milliseconds. For example,
  10 requests/second gets smoothed like this:</p>

  <p>1000 milliseconds (1 second) / 10 = 100-millisecond intervals, or about 1 request allowed
  every 100 milliseconds . A second request inside of 100ms will fail. Also, an 11th request within
  a second will fail.</p>

  <h4>When the limit is exceeded</h4>

  <p>If the number of requests exceeds the limit within the specified time interval, spike alert
  returns this error message with an HTTP 503 status:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{"error": "spike arrest policy violated"}
</pre>

  <h4><a id="Adding a buffer" name="Adding%20a%20buffer"></a>Adding a buffer</h4>

  <p>You have an option of adding a buffer to the policy. Let's say you set the buffer to 10.
  You'll see that the API does not return an error immediately when you exceed the spike arrest
  limit. Instead, requests are buffered (up to the number specified), and the buffered requests are
  processed as soon as the next appropriate execution window is available. The
  default <strong>bufferSize</strong> is 0.</p>

  <p>This section discusses the quota plugin.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> To use quota, OAuth authentication must be enabled in the

  <p>A quota specifies the number of request messages that an app is allowed to submit to an API

  <h3 id="usingthequotaplugin-productconfigurationinapigeeedge">Product configuration in Apigee

  <p>You configure quotas in the Apigee Edge UI where you configure API products. You need to know

  keys in the developer app, the quota will be applied to those API calls.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your Apigee Edge organization account.</li>

    <li>In the Edge UI, open the product associated with the microgateway-aware proxy to which
    you want to apply the quota.

  <h3 id="usingthequotaplugin-whatsthedifferencebetweenspikearrestandquota">What's the difference
  between spike arrest and quota?</h3>

  <p>It&#8217;s important to choose the right tool for the job at hand. Quota policies configure
  the number of request messages that a client app is allowed to submit to an API over the course
  of an hour, day, week, or month. The quota policy enforces consumption limits on client apps by
  maintaining a distributed counter that tallies incoming requests.</p>

  <p>Use a quota policy to enforce business contracts or SLAs with developers and partners, rather
  than for operational traffic management. For example, a quota might be used to limit traffic for
  a free service, while allowing full access for paying customers. See also <a href=
  "#Using%20the%20quota%20plugin">Using the quota plugin</a>.</p>

  <p>Use spike arrest to protect against sudden spikes in API traffic. Typically, spike arrest is
  used to head off possible DDoS or other malicious attacks.</p>{% endblock %}
