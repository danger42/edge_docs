  <h2 id="whatisthetracetool">What is the Trace tool?</h2>

  <p>Trace is a tool for troubleshooting and monitoring API proxies running on Apigee Edge. Trace
  lets you probe the details of each step through an API proxy flow. </p>

  <h2 id="howtousetrace">How to use Trace</h2>

  <p>Trace is simple to use. You start a trace session, then make an API call to the Edge platform,
  and read the results.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Trace tool:<br>
      <ul><li>In the <strong>New Edge UI</strong>: Select <strong>Develop > API Proxies</strong> in the left navigation bar.</li>
        <li>In the <strong>Edge Classic UI</strong>: Select <strong>APIs > API Proxies</strong> in the top navigation bar. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Select an API proxy from the API Proxies page.</li>

    <li>Be sure the API you wish to trace is deployed.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Trace</strong> to go to the Trace tool view. </li>

    <li>Use the <strong>Deployment to Trace</strong> dropdown menu to select which
    deployment environment and proxy revision you wish to trace. </li>

    <li>Click <b>Start Trace Session</b>. When the Trace session is active, the API proxy
    records details of each step in the processing pipeline. While the Trace session is running,
    messages and contextual data are captured from live traffic.<br>

      <p><img src="/api-platform/images/start-trace-session.png" width="118"></p>
    </li>

    <li>If you don't have any live traffic flowing through your proxy, then simply send a request
    to the API. You can use whatever tool you wish to send the request, such as cURL, Postman, or
    any familiar tool. Or, you can send the request directly from the Trace tool itself. Just enter
    the URL and click <strong>Send</strong>. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> One Trace session can support 10 request/response transactions per
    message processor through the selected API proxy. In Edge cloud, with 2 messages processors
    handling traffic, 20 request/response transactions are supported. A trace session automatically
    stops after 10 minutes if you don't manually stop it. <br>
     </li>

    <li>When you've captured a sufficient number of requests, click <b>Stop Trace
    Session</b>.</li>

    <li>A list of captured request/response transactions displays in the left menu. Click on any of
    the transactions to view detailed results.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="howtoreadatrace">How to read a trace</h2>

  <p>The trace tool has two main parts, the transaction map and the phase details:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The transaction map uses <a href="#TraceMapLegend">icons</a> to mark each notable
    step that occurs during an API proxy transaction, including policy execution, conditional
    steps, and transitions. Hover over any <a href="#TraceMapLegend">icon</a> to see summary
    information. The request flow steps appear along the top of the transaction map and response
    flow steps along the bottom.</li>

    <li>The <a href="#PhaseDetails">phase details</a> section of the tool lists
    information about the proxy's internal processing, including variables that were set or read,
    request and response headers, and much more. Click any icon to see the
      <a href="#PhaseDetails">phase details</a> for that step.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here's a sample trace tool map with the main proxy processing segments labeled:</p>

  <h2 id="refiningmessagecaptureusingfilters">Refining message capture using filters</h2>

  <p>You can filter which requests show up in the Trace tool by specifying header and/or query
  parameter values. Filters enable you to target specific calls that may be causing problems.
  For example, you may need to zero in on requests that have specific content or requests coming
  from specific partners or apps. You can filter on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTTP headers</strong> - Limit the trace to only calls that contain a specific
    header. This is a good way of helping you troubleshoot issues. You can send a header to your
    app developer and ask them to include it in the call that is causing issues. Then Apigee Edge
    will only record calls with that specific header so you can examine the results.  </li>

    <li><strong>Query parameters</strong> - Only calls with a  specific value of a parameter
    will be recorded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="refiningmessagecaptureusingfilters-thingsyouneedtoknowaboutthefilterfeature">
  <strong>Things you need to know about the Filter feature</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>You must restart your Trace session after specifying filter parameters in the filter
    fields.</li>

    <li>Filter parameters are AND'ed together. All specified query and/or header name/value pairs
    must be present in the request for a successful match. </li>

    <li>Pattern matching is not supported in the Filters tool.</li>

    <li>Filter parameters and values are case sensitive. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="refiningmessagecaptureusingfilters-howtocreateatracefilter"><strong>How to create a trace
  filter</strong></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>If a trace session is running, stop it by clicking <strong>Stop Trace
    Session</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Filters</strong> in the upper-left corner of the Trace tool to expand the
    Filters field.<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/trace-filters-closed.png"><br>
     </li>

    <li>In the Filters field, specify the query parameter and/or header values you wish to filter
    on. In this example, we specify two query parameters to filter on. Both parameters must be
    present in the request for a successful match. <br>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/trace-filters-opened-3.png"><br>
     </li>

    <li>Start the trace session.</li>

    <li>Call your APIs. Only requests that include all of the specified header(s) and/or query
    parameter(s) produce a successful match.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="debuggingwithtrace">Debugging with Trace</h2>

  <p>Trace lets you see a lot of internal details about an API proxy. For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can see at a glance which policies are executing correctly or failing. </li>

    <li>Let's say you noticed through one of the Analytics dashboards that one of your APIs is
    experiencing an unusual decrease in performance. Now, you can use Trace to help identify where
    the bottleneck is occurring. Trace gives the time, in milliseconds, that it takes for each
    processing step to complete. If you find one step is taking too long, you can take corrective
    action. </li>

    <li>By looking at the phase details, you can check headers that are being sent to the backend,
    view variables set by policies, and so on.</li>

    <li>By verifying the base path, you can ensure that a policy is routing the message to correct
    server.</li>

  <p>To download, click <b>Download Trace Session</b>.</p>

  <h2 id="showingrequestsascurl">Showing requests as cURL</h2>

  <p>After you trace an API call made to a target server, you can view the request as a cURL
  command. This is particularly useful for debugging for a couple of reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The API proxy may modify the request, so it's useful to see how request from the proxy to
    the target server differs from the original request. The cURL command represents the modified
    request.</li>

    <li>For larger message payloads, the cURL allows you to see the HTTP headers and message
    content in a single place. (There's currently a limit of about 1,000 characters. For a tip on
    getting past this limit, see
      <a href="https://community.apigee.com/content/kbentry/41114/how-to-trace-a-soap-message-on-apigee.html" target="_blank">this community post</a>.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For security, the cURL feature masks the HTTP Authorization header.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If request streaming is enabled on the API proxy (see
    <a href="/api-platform/develop/enabling-streaming.html">Streaming requests and responses</a>), the
  request body won't be available.</aside>

  <p>To see requests as cURL after an API call comes through in Trace, select the "Request sent to
  target server" stage in the Transaction Map diagram, then click the <strong>Show Curl</strong>
  button on the "Request sent to target server" column in the Phase Details pane.</p>
