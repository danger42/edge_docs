  <p>Server Name Indication (SNI) allows multiple HTTPS targets to be served off the same IP
  address and port without requiring those targets to use the same TLS certificate. When SNI is
  enabled on a client, the client passes the hostname of the target endpoint as part of the initial
  TLS handshake. That allows the TLS server to determine which TLS cert should be used to validate
  the request. </p>

  <p>For example, if the request target is <code>https://<strong>example.com</strong>/request/path</code>,
  then the TLS client adds the <code>server_name</code> extension to the TLS handshake
  request, as shown below:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/release/notes/images/SNI.png"></p>

  <p>Edge supports SNI for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Requests from a client app to an API proxy. In this scenario, Edge acts as the TLS
    server</li>

    <li>Requests from Edge to the backend. In this scenario, Edge acts as the TLS client.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="supportingsniforarequesttoapiproxyonedge">Supporting SNI for a request to API proxy on
  Edge</h2>

  <p>SNI support for requests to API proxies is controlled by hosts aliases and virtual
  hosts. </p>

  <h3 id="supportingsniforarequesttoapiproxyonedge-aboutvirtualhostsandhostaliases">About virtual
  hosts and host aliases</h3>

  <p>With Edge, a <em>virtual host</em> defines the IP address and port, or DNS name and port, on
  which an API proxy is exposed and, by extension, the URL that apps use to access an API proxy.
  The IP address/DNS name corresponds to an Edge Router, and the port number is an open port on the
  Router. </p>

  <p>When you create the virtual host, you also specify the host alias of the virtual host.
  Typically this is the DNS name of the virtual host. As part of determining the API proxy that
  handles the request, the Router compares the <code>Host</code> header of the incoming request to the
  list of available host aliases defined by all virtual hosts. </p>

  <p>The combination of host alias and port number for the virtual host must be unique for all
  virtual hosts in the Edge installation. That means <strong>multiple virtual hosts can use the
  same port number</strong> if they have different host aliases.</p>

  <p>A virtual host also defines whether the API proxy is accessed by using the HTTP protocol, or
  by the encrypted HTTPS protocol using TLS. When configuring a virtual host to use HTTPS,
  associate the virtual host with a keystore that contains the cert and private key used by the
  virtual host during TLS handshaking.</p>

  <h3 id="supportingsniforarequesttoapiproxyonedge-howsniworkswithhostaliases">How SNI works with
  host aliases</h3>

  <p>SNI allows you to have multiple virtual hosts defined on the same port, each with different
  TLS certs and keys. Edge then determines the virtual host, and the cert/key pair used by TLS,
  based on the <code>server_name</code>
  extension in the TLS handshake request.</p>

  <p>The Edge Router reads the <code>server_name</code> extension in the TLS handshake
  request, and then uses it to search against the <strong>host aliases</strong> from all virtual
  hosts. If the Router detects a match with a host alias, the Router uses the TLS cert and key from
  the virtual host associated with the host alias. If no match is found, TLS handshaking fails.</p>

  <p>Rather than having the TLS handshake fail, you can define a default cert/key pair, as
  described in the next sections. </p>

  <h3 id="supportingsniforarequesttoapiproxyonedge-definingadefaultcertkeypairinedgeforthecloud">
  Defining a default cert/key pair in Edge for the Cloud</h3>

  <p>Apigee provides a TLS certificate and private key to support HTTPS. While many customers
  prefer to use their own certificate and private key at deployment time, you can deploy your APIs
  using the Apigee cert and key.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> All Apigee Cloud customers use the same Apigee-provided cert.
  Therefore, if you are a Cloud customer and are doing two-way TLS to the backend, you should not
  use the Apigee-provided cert because it cannot be used to uniquely identify the owner of the API
  proxy connecting to the backend. </aside>

  <p>In Edge for the Cloud, if the Router cannot match the SNI header to a host alias or if the
  client does not support SNI, then the Router uses the default certificate provided by Apigee,
  which is *.apigee.net.</p>

  Defining a default cert/key pair in Edge for the Private Cloud</h3>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> This functionality is available for Edge for Private Cloud
  version 4.16.01 and later. </aside>

  <p>In Edge for the Private Cloud, if no match is found between the <code>server_name</code> extension and the host aliases
  from all virtual hosts, or if the requesting client does not support SNI, you can configure the
  Router to use the cert/key from a default virtual host on the port. The default virtual host is
  defined by a combination of organization name, environment name, and virtual host name, in the
  form:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint"><var>orgName_envName_vhName</var></pre>

  <p>The Router uses the cert/key from the combination of <var>orgName_envName_vhName</var> that
  comes first in alphabetical order. For example, the request comes in on port 443, and there are
  two virtual hosts defined for the org <code>example</code> in the environment <code>prod</code>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>virtual host name = <code>default</code></li>
    <li>virtual host name = <code>test</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this example, the Router uses the cert/key from the virtual host named <code>default</code>
    because <code>example_prod_default</code> comes alphabetically before <code>example_prod_test</code>.</p>

  <p>To enable the default virtual host:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>On the first Router node, edit <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/router.properties</code>.
    If that file does not exist, create it.</li>

    <li>Add the following property to the file to enable you to define a default virtual host:

    <pre class="prettyprint">conf_load_balancing_load.balancing.driver.nginx.fallback.conf.enabled=true</pre></li>

    <li>Restart the Router:
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-router restart</pre></li>

    <li>Repeat these steps on all remaining Routers. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Rather than use the cert/key from the default virtual host, you can explicitly define the
  default cert/key on the Router. Use the following procedure to define an explicit default
  cert/key pair:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>On the first Router node, copy the cert and private key to a location on the Router node
    that is accessible by the apigee user. For example, <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application</code>.</li>

    <li>Change ownership of the files to the 'apigee. user:

<pre class="devsite-terminal">chown apigee:apigee /opt/apigee/customer/application/myCert.pem</pre>
<pre class="devsite-terminal">chown apigee:apigee /opt/apigee/customer/application/myKey.pem</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Edit <code>/opt/apigee/customer/application/router.properties</code>.
    If that file does not exist, create it.</li>

    <li>Add the following properties to the file to enable you to specify the default cert/key:<br>
    <code>conf_load_balancing_load.balancing.driver.nginx.fallback.server.default.ssl.template.enabled=true<br>

    conf_load_balancing_load.balancing.driver.nginx.fallback.conf.enabled=true</code></li>

    <li>Set the followng properties in <code>router.properties</code> to specify the location
    of the certy and key:

<pre class="prettyprint">conf_load_balancing_load.balancing.driver.nginx.ssl.cert=/opt/apigee/customer/application/myCert.pem
conf_load_balancing_load.balancing.driver.nginx.ssl.key=/opt/apigee/customer/application/myKey.pem</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Restart the Router:

    <pre class="devsite-terminal">/opt/apigee/apigee-service/bin/apigee-service edge-router restart</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Repeat these steps on all remaining Routers. </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="supportingsniforrequestsfromedgetothebackend">Supporting SNI for requests from Edge to
  the backend </h2>

  <p>Edge supports the use of SNI from Message Processors to target endpoints in Apigee Edge for
  Cloud and for Private Cloud deployments. By default, SNI is enabled on Edge Message Processors
  for the Cloud and disabled in the Private Cloud.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Leaving SNI disabled can prevent the download of NPM packages.
  For example, a request in the form <code>/v1/o/org/apis/api/revisions/revision/npm</code> to
  download NPM packages fails with an error message in the form "Hostname/IP doesn't match
  certificate's altnames". If the target endpoint is SNI compliant, you can enable SNI, which also
  allows you to download NPM packages. </aside>
