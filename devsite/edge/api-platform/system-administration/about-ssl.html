  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}About TLS/SSL{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>TLS (Transport Layer Security, whose predecessor is SSL) is the standard security technology
  for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a web client, such as a browser or an
  app. An encrypted link ensures that all data passing between the server and the client remains
  private. To use TLS, a client makes a secure request to the server by using the encrypted
  <code>https</code> protocol, instead of the unencrypted <code>http</code> protocol.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Because Edge originally supported SSL, you will see some
  instances in the Edge UI and in the Edge XML that use the term "SSL". For example, the menu entry
  in the Edge UI that you use to view certs is called <strong>SSL Certificates</strong>. The
  XML tag that you use to configure a virtual host to use TLS is named <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&lt;SSLInfo&gt;</span>. </aside>

  <p>Edge supports one-way TLS and two-way TLS in both a cloud and an on-premises deployment (see
  <a href="/release/supported-software.html">Supported software and supported versions</a> for
  supported versions of TLS). One-way TLS enables the TLS client to verify the identity of the TLS
  server. For example, an app running on an Android phone (client) can verify the identity of Edge
  APIs (server).</p>

  <p>Apigee also supports a stronger form of authentication using two-way, or client, TLS. You
  typically implement two-way TLS to enhance security end-to-end and protect your data from client
  attacks such as client spoofing or man-in-the middle attacks. In two-way TLS, the client verifies
  the identity of the server followed by the server verifying the identity of the client.</p>

  <h2 id="tlsterminology">TLS terminology</h2>

  <p>You should be familiar with some important terms and concepts before configuring TLS:</p>

          <p>A digital file that identifies an entity in a TLS transaction. A certificate, or
          <em>cert</em>, can be used to identify the TLS server and TLS client, depending on the
          TLS configuration.</p>

          <p>Often you will not have a certificate signed by your CA's root private key. Instead,
          you have your cert along with one or more intermediate certs that form a chain. The last

          You typically generate a CSR when you have an expired cert and want to renew
          it. </p>

  <h2 id="onewaytlsssl">One-way TLS/SSL</h2>

  <p>The following figure shows TLS/SSL handshaking for one-way authentication between a TLS client
  and TLS server. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/oneWaySSL_tls.png"></p>

  <p>In a one-way TLS configuration:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The client issues a session request to the server.</li>

    <li>The server responds with a certificate, which contains its public key. This certificate
    comes from the server's keystore, which also contains the server's private key. The private key
    is never sent to the client.</li>

    <li>For a signed cert, the client makes a request to the Certificate Authority (CA) to
    authenticates the certificate.</li>

    <li>The client and server exchange several more messages to validate keys.</li>

    <li>The client begins TLS data transfer with the server. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following figure shows TLS/SSL handshaking using an optional truststore on the client:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/oneWaySSLTrustStore_tls.png"></p>

  <p>If the TLS server uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate that is not signed by a
  trusted CA, then you create a truststore on the client. The client populates its truststore with
  server certificates and public keys that it trusts. When the client receives a certificate, the
  incoming certificate is then validated against the certificates in its truststore. </p>

  <p>In one-way TLS, Edge can be either the server or the client:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edge as the TLS server</strong><br>
    <br>
    Edge is the server hosting the TLS endpoint, where the TLS endpoint corresponds to an API proxy
    deployed to a virtual host. The client is an app attempting to access the API proxy. In this
    scenario, Edge has the keystore containing the certificate and private key.</li>

    <li><strong>Edge as the TLS client</strong><br>
    <br>
    Edge acts as the client that accesses a backend service. In this case, the backend service
    corresponds to the server hosting a TLS endpoint. The backend server therefore has a keystore
    that contains its certificate and private key.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="twowaytls">Two-way TLS</h2>

  <p>The following figure shows the TLS/SSL handshaking for two-way TLS authentication between a
  client and server:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/twoWaySSL_tls.png"></p>

  <p>In two-way TLS:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The client and server both have their own keystores. The
    client's keystore contains its cert and private key, and the
    server's keystore contains its cert and private key.</li>

    <li>The TLS server presents its certificate to the TLS client to authenticate itself. The
    client then verifies the identity of the server prior to sending its cert to the server.</li>

    <li>The TLS client presents its certificate to the TLS server to authenticate itself to the
    server. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following figure shows TLS handshaking using an optional truststore:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/twoWaySSLTrustStore_tls.png"></p>

  <p>In this scenario:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the TLS <strong>server</strong> uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate
    that is not signed by a trusted CA, then you create a truststore on the
    <strong>client</strong>. The <strong>client</strong> has a copy of the
    <strong>server's</strong> cert in its truststore. During TLS handshaking, the
    <strong>client</strong> compares the cert in its truststore to the cert send from the
    <strong>server</strong> to verify the identity of the <strong>server</strong>.</li>

    <li>If the TLS <strong>client</strong> uses a self-signed certificate or a
    certificate that is not signed by a trusted CA, then you create a truststore on the
    <strong>server</strong>.The <strong>server</strong> has a copy of the <strong>client's</strong>
    cert in its truststore. During TLS handshaking, the <strong>server</strong> compares the cert
    in its truststore to the cert send from the <strong>client</strong> to verify the
    identity of the <strong>client</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Either the client or server can use a truststore, or both can.</p>

  <p>In two-way TLS, Edge can be either the server or the client:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edge as the server</strong><br>
    <br>
    Edge is the server hosting the TLS endpoint, where the TLS endpoint corresponds to an API
    proxy. The client is an app attempting to access the API proxy. In this scenario, Edge has a
    keystore containing the certificate and private key, and requires a truststore containing the
    client's cert and CA chain.</li>

    <li><strong>Edge as the client</strong><br>
    <br>
    Edge acts as a client that accesses a backend service. In this case, the backend service
    corresponds to the server hosting the TLS endpoint. The backend server therefore has a keystore
    that contains its certificate and private key.<br>
    <br>
    Edge must also define a keystore that contains the certificate needed to validate itself to the
    backend service, and optionally a truststore containing the cert from the backend server if the
    server uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate that is not signed by a trusted
    CA,.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The important thing to remember is that Edge is flexible enough to support two-way TLS
  regardless of how you decide to configure it.  </p>

  <h2 id="servernameindicationsnisupport">Server Name Indication (SNI) support</h2>

  <p>Edge supports the use of Server Name Indication (SNI) from API proxies to Edge, where
  Edge acts as the TLS server, and from Edge to target endpoints, where Edge acts as the TLS
  client, in both Cloud and Private Cloud installations.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> For Private Cloud installations, <strong>Java 1.7 or
  later</strong> is required.</aside>

  <p>With SNI, which is an extension of TLS/SSL, multiple HTTPS targets can be served off the same
  IP address and port without requiring those targets to use the same certificate.</p>

  <p>For information on enabling SNI for an on-premises installation, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/using-sni-edge.html">Using SNI with Edge</a>.</p>{% endblock %}
