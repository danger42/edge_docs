  <p>This topic explains how to create custom roles in the management UI. Only an organization
  administrator can create custom roles.</p>

  <h2 id="whatarecustomroles">What are custom roles?</h2>

  <p>Each Edge organization comes with a few built-in roles that provide different permission
  levels. You can assign administrative users to any of these roles. However, you can also create
  unique roles that include the exact permissions you want. For example, you might want a role that
  allows access to API proxies only, nothing else. To do that, you'd create a custom role.</p>

  <p>You can create custom roles to fine-tune access to these Apigee Edge entities. For
  example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>API proxies</li>

    <li>API products</li>

    <li>Developer apps</li>

    <li>Developers</li>

    <li>Environments (Trace tool sessions and deployments)</li>

    <li>Custom reports (Analytics)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can achieve even more granularity by applying role based access to <strong>specific
  instances</strong> of an entity. For example, you can apply role-based access to all API products
  or to specific ones. </p>

  <h2 id="precedence">Precedence</h2>

  <p>More granular permissions take precedence over less granular ones. For example, permissions
  applied to a specific developer app take precedence over a less-granular permission applied to
  all developer apps.</p>

  <h2 id="wholegroupsofentitiesvssingleinstances">Whole groups of entities vs. single
  instances</h2>

  <p>You can set some custom role permissions on a group of entities (e.g., <strong>all</strong>
  API products) or on a single instance (e.g., <strong>one specific</strong> product).</p>

  <p>If you set permissions on an instance, a privileged user can perform the permitted operations
  on that instance only. If set on a group (e.g., all API proxies), the user can perform the
  operations on any instance in the collection. </p>

  <p>You can also enable <strong>deploy</strong> and <strong>trace</strong> options on APIs and
  caches. These operations are also environment specific. That is, you can allow a role to deploy
  only to the prod environment. </p>

  <h2 id="usingthemanagementuitocreatecustomroles">Using the management UI to create custom
  roles</h2>

  <p>An org administrator can create custom roles through the management UI.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Role names <a href=
  "/advisory/naming-and-input-error-advisories.html#VALIDATION_ERR_ROLENAME">cannot contain special
  characters</a>.</aside>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Admin &gt; Organization Roles</strong>. </li>

    <li>Click <strong>+ Custom Role</strong>. </li>

    <li>Use the New Custom Role dialog to create the custom role. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The following screen shot shows part of the New Custom Role dialog. For example, this role is
  called WeatherApiRole, and it allows a user to view, edit, and delete an API proxy with the path
  <code>/weatherapi</code>. In addition, this user can view trace sessions in both prod and test
  environements, but can only deploy to the test environment. </p>

  <h2 id="usingtheapitocreateandassignroles">Using the API to create and assign roles</h2>

  <p>You can also use the management API to create custom roles and assign roles to users. For
  details, see <a href="/api-platform/system-administration/managing-roles-api.html">Creating roles
  with the API</a>.</p>
