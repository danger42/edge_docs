  <p>Two-factor authentication is an easy-to-use best practice that adds an additional layer of
  protection for your Apigee account. To log in to your account when two-factor auth is enabled,
  you must supply your username and password and a 6-digit number. The number is randomly
  generated, changes every 30 seconds and can only be used only one time to log in.</p>

  <p>This topic explains how to set up and use two-factor auth.</p>

  <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> <strong>Do not enable two-factor authentication on Apigee
