  <p>This topic discusses how to create custom roles and assign roles to users through the
  management API. We also show how to test role assignments through the API. (For an overview of
  custom roles, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/creating-custom-roles.html">Creating custom roles in the
  UI</a>.)</p>

  <h2 id="aboutpermissionsetting">About permission setting</h2>

  <p>Role permissions are set on management API URIs (not management UI URIs). For example, if you
  want to set PUT, GET, and/or DELETE permissions on the app developer entities in your Edge
  organization, you'd set permissions on the <code>/developers</code> resource, because the
  management API path for <a href=
  "/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/developers">developers</a> is
  <code>https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}<strong>/developers</strong></code>.
  (You don't need to include the organization part of the path when defining permissions, because
  permissions are scoped to a specific organization, as the management API calls in this topic
  illustrate.)</p>

  <p>You can also set permissions on specific entities. For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you wanted to set permissions on a single developer, set them on
    <code>/developers/steve@example.com</code></li>

    <li>For a specific API product, such as free-api-product, set them
    on <code>/apiproducts/free-api-product</code></li>

    <li>For a key value map in a specific environment, you'd set permission on something like
    <code>/environments/test/keyvaluemaps/fooMap</code>, or
    <code>/environments/test/keyvaluemaps/*</code> for all key value maps in the test
    environment.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Names of entities, such as API products, apps, etc. should not
  contain spaces.</aside>

  <p>The permissions you set using the API:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Allow users in a custom role to make <a href="/management/apis">management API
    calls</a> according to their permissions. For example, if a role allows read-only access
    to all API proxies, a user in that role could use the <a href=
    "/management/apis/get/organizations/{org_name}/apis">List API Proxies</a> API but not the
    <a href="/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/apis">Create an API Proxy</a> API.</li>

    <li>Determine what users in a custom role can see and do in the management UI. For example,
    read-only access to API proxies disables access to the +API Proxy and Delete buttons on the API
    Proxies page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To see the resources and paths that you can set permissions on, look through the <a href=
  "/management/apis">management API reference</a> at the different resource URLs.</p>

  <p>See the <a href="/api/user-roles">User roles</a> API for complete reference information on
  role management.</p>

  <h3 id="aboutpermissionsetting-syntaxandprecedence">Syntax and precedence</h3>

  <p>You can use the asterisk wild card (*) to indicate "everything after" in a permission setting.
  However, if you set permissions only on a parent resource (such as on /developers) without
  setting any more specific permissions (such as /developers/*), the permission applies to
  everything from /developers and after.</p>

  <p>PUT also serves as POST in permissions.</p>

  <p>You can mix general with more granular permissions on resources. The more granular settings
  take precedence where there is a permissions overlap. For example, assume the following
  permissions are set on a "developeradmin" role:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>PUT on /developers</li>

    <li>GET on /developers/*</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This means the developeradmin can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a developer, but not update any specific developers or any sub-entities (because of
    the more specific GET permission on that path).</li>

    <li>Get any developer or sub-entity, but not get a list of all developers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="createanewcustomrolecalleddevelopment">Create a new custom role called "development"</h2>

  <p>Create a 'development' role to enable developers to view, create, and update API proxies.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{ "role" : [ { "name" : "development" } ] }'
</pre>

  <h2 id="addpermissionstothedevelopmentrole">Add permissions to the development role</h2>

  <p>The permissions that can be set on an entire group of Edge artifacts (such as all /apps,
  /apis, /apiproducts, and so on) as well as on individual artifacts (such as a specific app, API
  proxy, or API product) are GET, PUT, and DELETE. </p>

  <p>GET enables users to view any APIs, including API proxy configuration files, associated
  policies, Javascript, XSLT files, and so on. The PUT permission on APIs enables developers to
  create, modify, import, export, deploy and undeploy API proxies.</p>

  <p>The path attribute specifies the artifact on which you set the permissions. For example,
   /applications, /apps, /apiproducts, /developers, or /reports.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles/development/permissions -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"path" : "/applications","permissions" : [ "put", "get" ]}'
</pre>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The role resource path for all proxies is <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/applications</span> and for a specific API proxy it
  is <code>/applications/&lt;proxy_name&gt;</code>.</aside>

  <h2 id="createaroletesting">Create a role: testing</h2>

  <p>Create a 'testing' role to enable quality engineers to view API proxies and their contents
  (including, for example, policies).</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{ "role" : [ { "name" : "testing" } ] }'
</pre>

  <h2 id="addpermissionstotestingrole">Add permissions to testing role</h2>

  <p>GET enables users to view any APIs, including their configuration files, as well as any
  associated policies, JavaScript, XSLT files, and so on. By adding this permission to the
  'testing' role, we enable quality engineers to view the contents of the APIs that they are
  testing. Users in this role will not, however, be able to create, modify, import, export, deploy
  and undeploy API proxies.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles/testing/permissions -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"path" : "/applications","permissions" : [ "get" ]}'
</pre>

  <p>For an on-premises installation of Edge, the minimum set of permissions that have to be set to
  allow the user to log in to the Edge UI are:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{"path" : "/","permissions" : [ "get" ]}
{"path" : "/*","permissions" : [ ]}
{"path" : "/environments","permissions" : [ "get" ]}
{"path" : "/userroles","permissions" : [ "get" ]}
</pre>

  <p>Use the following cURL command to set these permissions:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -u email:password \
-X POST \
http://&lt;<em>ms-IP</em>&gt;:8080/v1/organizations/{org_name}/userroles/testing/resourcepermissions  \
-d '{
 "resourcePermission" : [ 
   {
    "path" : "/",
    "permissions" : [ "get" ]
   }, 
{
    "path" : "/*",
    "permissions" : []
   },
{
    "path" : "/environments",
    "permissions" : [ "get" ]
   },
   {
    "path" : "/userroles",
    "permissions" : [ "get"]
   }
  ]
}'
</pre>

  <p>where <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><em>&lt;ms-IP&gt;</em></span>
  is the IP address or DNS name of the Edge Management Server.</p>

  <h2 id="addusertotestingrole">Add user to testing role</h2>

  <p>To provision a user with a user role:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/users/justauser@apigee.com/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"role" : [ {"name" : "testing"} ] }'
</pre>

  <h2 id="viewapisasuser">View APIs as user</h2>Impersonate the user and make a request to API
  Services to view API proxies. The user should be able to view APIs, along with their contents.
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis
</pre>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/{api_name}/policies
</pre>

  <h2 id="createapiasuserintestingrole">Create API as user in testing role</h2>

  <p>Impersonate the user and make a request to API Services to create an API proxy. The request
  will be rejected by API Services, as the role 'testing' does not permit the user to create
  APIs.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -X POST -d'{"name" : "rbacTestApi"}'
</pre>

  <h2 id="addusertodevelopmentrole">Add user to development role</h2>

  <p>Now provision the user with the 'development' role.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/users/justauser@apigee.com/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"role" : [ {"name" : "development"} ] }'
</pre>

  <h2 id="createapiasuserindevelopmentrole">Create API as user in development role</h2>

  <p>Impersonate the user and repeat the request to the API Platform to create an API proxy. The
  request will be successful, as the role 'development' does permit the user to create APIs.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -X POST -d'{"name" : "rbacTestApi"}'
</pre>

  <h2 id="getuserrolesforauser">Get user roles for a user</h2>

  <p>As an organization administrator, you can check the list of user roles for a user (across all
  organizations) at any time:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -u email:password -X GET https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/users/justauser@apigee.com/userroles
</pre>{% endblock %}
