  <aside class="note"><b>Private Cloud:</b> <b>Edge on-premises installation only. </b>In a
  Cloud-based installation of Edge, Apigee functions in the role of read-only system administrator.
  You can only assign global users to the read-only system administrator role in an Edge for the
  Private Cloud installation.</aside>

  <p>An <strong>Edge read-only system administrator</strong> has access to the same
  entities as an system administrator but access is read-only. A read-only system administrator
  can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Perform the operations of the <a href=
    "/api-platform/system-administration/edge-built-roles.html">Edge built-in roles</a> for all
    organizations</li>

    <li>View global user details</li>

    <li>View organization, environment, and virtual host configurations</li>

    <li>Make read-only calls to all Edge system administrative APIs</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> While it is not required, you can assign a read-only system
  administrator to an organization, typically as a read-only organization administrator. Unless
  assigned to an organization, the read-only system administrator cannot log in to the Edge
  management UI.</aside>
