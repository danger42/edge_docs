  <p>Apigee Edge has several entry points that you might want to secure with TLS. In addition, Edge
  add-ons, such as the Developer Services portal, have entry points that can be configured to use
  TLS.</p>

  <p>The Edge TLS configuration procedure depends on how you deployed Edge: <strong>Apigee
  Edge cloud</strong> or <strong>Apigee Edge for Private Cloud</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Cloud-based deployment</h2>

  <p>In a cloud-based deployment of Edge you are only responsible for configuring TLS access from
  to API proxies and to your target endpoints.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Free and trial accounts cannot configure TLS for API proxies.
  Instead, Apigee automatically provides a TLS certificate and private key to support HTTPS on a
  secure virtual host so that trial customers can get started developing and testing APIs. For more
  information on Edge pricing plans, see <a href=
  "https://,%20or%20in%20a%20custom%20role%20with%20permissions%20to%20modify%20a%20virtual%20host">
  https://apigee.com/api-management/#/pricing</a>.  </aside>

  <p>For the cloud version of the Developer Services portal, you configure TLS on on the Pantheon
  hosting server.</p>

  <p>For more, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/configuring-ssl-cloud-based-edge-installation.html">Using
  TLS in a cloud-based Edge installation</a>.</p>

  <h2>Private Cloud deployment</h2>

  <p>For an Apigee Edge for Private Cloud installation of the Developer Services portal, you are
  completely responsible for configuring TLS. That means you not only have to obtain the TLS
  certificate and private key, but you also have to configure Edge to use TLS.</p>

  <p>For more, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/configuring-ssl-premises-edge-installation.html">Using TLS
  in a Private Cloud installation</a>.</p>

  <h2>Supported versions of TLS</h2>

  <p>The supported versions of TLS depend on wether you are using Edge in the Cloud or
    Edge for the Private Cloud:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edge in the Cloud</strong>:

      Supports TLS version 1.2 only. Support for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 for the Cloud
      have been retired. For more information,
      see <a class="external" href="https://docs.apigee.com/release/notes/tls-retirement">TLS 1.0 and 1.1 retirement</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Edge for the Private Cloud</strong>:

      Supports TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="whereedgeusestls">Where Edge uses TLS</h2>

  <p>The following images shows the places in an Edge installation where you can configure TLS:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/EdgeSSL_v2.png"></p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Most of the connections between the Edge components have been
  omitted to simplify this image.</aside>

  <p>Apigee Edge for Private Cloud customers typically configure all connections to use TLS.
  However, for cloud customers, Apigee handles most of the TLS configuration for you and only have
  to configure TLS for connections 3 and 4 shown in the figure.  </p>

  <p>The following table describes these TLS connections:</p>

  <p>The following image shows a scenario where the API client accesses Edge through a load
  balancer, rather than accessing the Router directly:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/EdgeSSLELB.png"></p>

  <p>The cloud-based version of Edge is typically configured to use a load balancer. For Private
  Cloud installations, the presence of a load balancer is dependent on your network configuration
  of Edge.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Load balancers often cannot be configured to support two-way
  TLS.</aside>

  <p>When using a load balancer, you can configure TLS between the API client and the load balancer
  and, if necessary, between the load balancer and the Router, as the following table
  describes:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th> </th>

        <th>
          <p><strong>Source</strong></p>

        <td>

          load balancer forwards the request to an Edge Router.</p>

          <p>You can configure TLS on the entry point of the load balancer. The way you configure
          TLS is based on the load balancer.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>

          <p>Router</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Depending on your configuration, you might configure TLS access to the Router from the
          load balancer. In that case, you configure TLS just as if the load balancer was not
          present.</p>

          <p>Or, if the load balancer and Router are in the same security domain, TLS configuration
          may not be necessary. However, that is dependent on your network configuration.</p>
