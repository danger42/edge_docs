  <p>To configure TLS, you have to configure the following on Edge:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Repositories for TLS keys and certs:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keystores</strong>: Contains an TLS certificate and private key used to
        identify the entity during TLS handshaking. When you create the keystore and upload the TLS
        cert, you specify an <strong><em>alias</em></strong> name used to reference the cert/key
        pair.</li>

        <li><strong>Truststores</strong>: contains certificates used to verify certificates
        received as part of TLS handshaking. A truststore is usually not required. It is used when
        you have to validate self-signed certificates received from the TLS server, or certificates
        that are not signed by a trusted CA. It is also required when performing two-way TLS when
        Edge acts as the TLS server.  </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>API proxies to use the certs in keystores and truststores:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual Hosts</strong>: defines the domains and ports on which an API proxy is
        exposed, and, by extension, the URL that apps use to access an API proxy. As part of
        configuring a virtual host, you optionally specify a keystore and truststore as
        part of configuring TLS.</li>

        <li><strong>Target Endpoints/Target Servers</strong>: defines endpoint of the
        backend system accessed by an API proxy. As part of configuring a target endpoints/target
        servers, you configure it to support the TLS requirements of the backend system, including
        specifying a keystore and truststore.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="cloudvsprivatecloudconfigurationdifferences">Cloud vs. Private Cloud configuration
  differences</h2>

  <p>Both Edge cloud and Edge for Private Cloud let you create and configure keystores and
  truststores.</p>

  <p>The biggest difference between the two is that in a Cloud-based installation of Edge, only
  paid customers with a support plan can create and modify virtual hosts to configure TLS. Free and
  trial accounts are limited to the virtual hosts created for them at Edge registration time. For
  more information on Edge pricing plans, see <a href=
  "https://apigee.com/api-management/#/pricing">https://apigee.com/api-management/#/pricing</a>.
   </p>

  <p>Both cloud and Private Cloud customers can create and configure target endpoints and target
  servers.</p>
