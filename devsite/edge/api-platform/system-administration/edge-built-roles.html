  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}Edge built-in roles{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>Each Apigee Edge organization comes with a few built-in roles that you can assign to
  administrative users:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Organization Administrator</strong> - Super user. Has full CRUD access to resources
    in the organization. In an Edge for Private Cloud installation, the most powerful role is the
    <a href="/api-platform/system-administration/system-administrator-role.html">System
    administrator role</a>, which also has access to system-level functions that the Organization
    Administrator doesn't.</li>

    <li><strong>Read-only Organization Administrator</strong> - Has read-only access to resources
    in the organization.</li>

    <li><strong>Operations Administrator</strong> - Deploys and tests APIs; has read-only access to
    other resources.</li>

    <li><strong>Business User</strong> - Creates and manages API products, developers, developer
    apps, and companies; creates custom reports on API usage; has read-only access to other
    resources.</li>

    <li><strong>User</strong> - Creates API proxies and tests them in the test environment; has
    read-only access to other resources.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The built-in roles control the level of access in both the management UI and the management
  API.</p>

  <p>To see the permissions set for each built-in role (as an Organization Administrator or a
  Read-only Organization Administrator), select <strong>Admin &gt; Organization Roles &gt;
  name_of_role</strong> in the management UI.</p>

  <h2 id="examplerolepermission">Example role permission</h2>

  <p>The following example in the management UI shows the permissions for the User role. Notice
  that it has different deployment permissions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>/deployments URI (GET)</li>

    <li>/environments/*/applications/*/revisions/*/deployments (GET)</li>

    <li>/environments/test/applications/*/revisions/*/deployments (GET, PUT, DELETE)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img alt=
  "Users role permissions for deployment, showing PUT permissions on only deployments to the test environment."
  src="/api-platform/images/role_users_deploy.png"></p>

  <p>So what does this mean? What can someone in the User role deploy?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First, the PUT permission is what allows deployment.</li>

    <li>Second, the more granular (specific) permission takes precedence where there is a
    permissions overlap, as there is with multiple deployment permissions here. (Precedence in
    permissions that overlap is described more fully in <a href=
    "/api-platform/system-administration/managing-roles-api.html">Creating roles with the
    API</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this example, the most granular permission is the "Deploy API to test environment
  permission" with a URI of /environments/test/applications/*/revisions/*/deployments. It's the
  /test/ part that makes it the most specific. It means someone in the User role can deploy any API
  proxy (/applications/*) with any revision (/revisions/*) to the test environment (/test/).</p>

  <p>Someone in this role, on the other hand, would not be able to deploy to any other environment,
  because of the GET (read-only) permission on /environments/*/, where the wildcard (*) signifies
  <em>any</em>. (The GET permission on /deployments allows the user to get deployment details with
  the <a href="/api/deployments" target="_blank">API</a>).</p>

  <h2 id="aboutthedeveloperadministratorrole">About the Developer Administrator role</h2>

  <p>When a Developer Portal is provisioned for you, another role is added to your organization
  called <strong>Developer Administrator</strong>. This role, which includes a single user called
  <code>devadmin+{org_name}@apigee.com</code>, is solely for the purpose of connecting your
  Developer Portal to your Edge organization. Because the portal displays your Edge developer apps,
  API products, and so on, it must stay in sync with your Edge organization by making management
  API calls that require authentication. The devadmin "user" has the necessary permissions.</p>

  <p>The connection between the portal and your Edge organization is configured in Drupal under
  <strong>Configuration &gt; Dev Portal</strong> in the Drupal admin menu (you must be logged into
  Drupal as an administrator). If the Connection Status is shown as "Connection Successful," you
  won't see the devadmin user in the configuration. However, if the connection is shown as failed,
  you must make a request to <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee Support</a> to change
  the connection information. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/creating-developer-portal.html">Creating a developer portal</a> for
  more. </p>

  <p>Don't add real users to the Developer Administrator role. (In fact, the management UI and API
  shouldn't let you.) That role should contain only the devadmin user.</p>{% endblock %}
