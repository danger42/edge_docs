  <p>Each Apigee Edge organization comes with a few built-in roles that you can assign to
  administrative users:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Organization Administrator</strong> - Super user. Has full CRUD access to resources
    in the organization. In an Edge for Private Cloud installation, the most powerful role is the
    <a href="/api-platform/system-administration/system-administrator-role.html">System
    administrator role</a>, which also has access to system-level functions that the Organization
    Administrator doesn't.</li>

    <li><strong>Read-only Organization Administrator</strong> - Has read-only access to resources
    in the organization.</li>

    <li><strong>Operations Administrator</strong> - Deploys and tests APIs; has read-only access to
    other resources.</li>

    <li><strong>Business User</strong> - Creates and manages API products, developers, developer
    apps, and companies; creates custom reports on API usage; has read-only access to other
    resources.</li>

    <li><strong>User</strong> - Creates API proxies and tests them in the test environment; has
    read-only access to other resources.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The built-in roles control the level of access in both the management UI and the management
  API.</p>

  <p>To see the permissions set for each built-in role (as an Organization Administrator or a
  Read-only Organization Administrator), select <strong>Admin &gt; Organization Roles &gt;
  name_of_role</strong> in the management UI.</p>

<p>If your organization includes Apigee Sense, the admin console will also display roles for Sense.
  For more about Apigee Sense roles, see <a href="/sense/sense-built-in-roles.html">Apigee Sense
  built-in roles</a>.

  <h2 id="examplerolepermission">Example role permission</h2>

  <p>The following example in the management UI shows the permissions for the User role. Notice
  that it has different deployment permissions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>/deployments URI (GET)</li>

    <li>/environments/*/applications/*/revisions/*/deployments (GET)</li>

    <li>/environments/test/applications/*/revisions/*/deployments (GET, PUT, DELETE)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img alt=
  "Users role permissions for deployment, showing PUT permissions on only deployments to the test environment."
  src="/api-platform/images/role_users_deploy.png"></p>

  <p>So what does this mean? What can someone in the User role deploy?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First, the PUT permission is what allows deployment.</li>

    <li>Second, the more granular (specific) permission takes precedence where there is a
    permissions overlap, as there is with multiple deployment permissions here. (Precedence in
    permissions that overlap is described more fully in <a href=
    "/api-platform/system-administration/managing-roles-api.html">Creating roles with the
    API</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this example, the most granular permission is the "Deploy API to test environment
  permission" with a URI of /environments/test/applications/*/revisions/*/deployments. It's the
  /test/ part that makes it the most specific. It means someone in the User role can deploy any API
  proxy (/applications/*) with any revision (/revisions/*) to the test environment (/test/).</p>

  <p>Someone in this role, on the other hand, would not be able to deploy to any other environment,
  because of the GET (read-only) permission on /environments/*/, where the wildcard (*) signifies
  <em>any</em>. (The GET permission on /deployments allows the user to get deployment details with
  the <a href="/api/deployments" target="_blank">API</a>).</p>

  <h2 id="aboutthedeveloperadministratorrole">About the Developer Administrator role</h2>

<p>When a Developer Portal is provisioned, the <strong>Developer Administrator</strong> role is
  added to your organization, typically with the <code>devadmin+{org_name}@apigee.com</code> user assigned to it.
  This role is used solely for the purpose of configuring the connection between
  the Developer Portals and your Edge organization. See <a href="https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/publish/drupal/communicating-between-developer-services-portal-and-edge">Communicating between the portal and Edge</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to assign the Developer Administrator role to another user account, create the account in your
  organization and contact support to assign the role.</p>
<aside class="note">It is recommended that you create a generic user account that all developer administrators can use. If you assign the role to an individual user account,
  communication may be impacted if the user account is deleted after transferring or leaving the company, for example.</aside>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a custom role with the same permissions as the Developer Administrator role using the script described in
  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-edge/configure-the-connection-to-apigee-edge" target="_blank">Assign the
    Developer Administrator role</a> in the Apigee Edge Drupal 8 module documentation.</p>
<p>The connection between the portal and your Edge organization can be viewed in Drupal under
  <strong>Configuration &gt; Dev Portal &gt; Application Settings</strong> in the Drupal admin menu (you must be logged into
  Drupal as an administrator). If the connection is shown as failed,
  you must contact <a href=
  "https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee Support</a> to change
  the connection information. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/publish/drupal/creating-developer-portal.html">Creating a developer portal</a> for
  more. </p>{% endblock %}
