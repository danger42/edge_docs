{% block title %}Access the management API with SAML{% endblock %}
{% block body %}

  <p>SAML supports a single sign-on (SSO) environment. By using SAML with Edge, you can support SSO
  for the Edge UI and API in addition to any other services that you provide and that also support
  SAML.</p>

  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> You must <a href="saml-overview">enable SAML</a> for at least
  one organization before you can use it to access the management API.</p>


<h2>Differences between SAML and OAuth2</h2>

  <p>Once SAML is set up, using it is very similar to using <a href="using-oauth2">OAuth2 to access
  the management API</a>. When you call the management API, you include an OAuth2 access token in
  your request.</p>

  <p>The key differences between SAML and OAuth2 when accessing the management API are in the way
  you get tokens. With SAML, you must include the following when getting your passcode and
  tokens:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Zones:</strong> Reference your zone name when getting your tokens</li>
    <li><strong>Initial passcode:</strong> Include a one-time passcode (when generating the initial
    access token)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The endpoints for the management API calls are the same for both SAML and OAuth2.</p>

  <p>To get access tokens with SAML, you can either use the {{get_token}} utility or the management
  API. Each of these approaches is described in the sections that follow.</p>

<h2>Get access tokens with get_token</h2>

  <p>You can use the {{get_token}} utility to exchange your credentials for OAuth2 access and
  refresh tokens that you use with SAML.</p>

  {{curl_blurb}}

  <p><strong>To get an access token with get_token:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Set the <code>SSO_LOGIN_URL</code> environment variable to your login URL. The login URL has
      the following form:
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com</pre>
      <p>For example, for a zone named "acme", set <code>SSO_LOGIN_URL</code> to "https://acme.login.apigee.net",
      as the following example shows:</p>
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">export SSO_LOGIN_URL=https://acme.login.apigee.com</pre>
    </li>
    <li>In a browser, go to the following URL to obtain a one-time passcode:
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com/passcode</pre>
      <p>For example, for a zone named "acme", go to the following URL:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://acme.login.apigee.com/passcode</pre>
      <p>If you are not currently logged in by your identity provider, you will be prompted to log
      in.</p>
      <p>This URL returns a one-time passcode that remains valid until you refresh that URL to
      obtain a new passcode, or you use the passcode with <code>get_token</code> to generate an
      access token.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Invoke <code>get_token</code> to obtain the OAuth2 access token:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">get_token</pre>
      <p>You are prompted to enter the one-time passcode that you obtained in the previous step:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">One Time Code ( Get one at https://acme.login.apigee.com/passcode )
Enter the passcode if SAML is enabled or press ENTER:</pre>
      <p>Enter the passcode. The <code>get_token</code> utility obtains the OAuth2 tokens,
      prints the access token to <code>stdout</code>, and writes the access and refresh tokens
      to <code>~/.sso-cli</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Call the management API and pass the access token in the <code>Authorization: Bearer</code>
      header, as the following example shows:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl <strong>-H "Authorization: Bearer <var>ACCESS_TOKEN</var>"</strong>
  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/ahamilton-eval</pre>
      <p>You got the value of the access token from <code>~/.sso-cli</code>.</p>
      <p>This example gets details about the given organization. For a complete list of management
      API endpoints, see {{apiref}}.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>When your access token expires, you can call <code>get_token</code> again to get a new access
  token. You will not be prompted for a new passcode until the refresh token expires..</p>

  <p>When the refresh token expires, <code>get_token</code> prompts you for a new passcode. You must
  generate a new passcode before you can generate a new OAuth access token.</p>

  <h2 id="refresh">Get access tokens with the management API</h2>

  <p>You can use the management API to get access tokens that you use with SAML. To authenticate
  yourself with the management API, you use a passcode on your initial request to get an access
  token, and again to get a refresh token.</p>

  <p>To get an access token with the management API:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In a browser, go to the following URL to obtain a one-time passcode:
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com/passcode</pre>
      <p>For example, for a zone named "acme", go to the following URL:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://acme.login.apigee.com/passcode</pre>
      <p>The passcode essentially acts as your credentials to get your tokens.</p>
      <p>If you are not currently logged in by your identity provider, you will be prompted to log
      in.</p>
      <p>This URL returns a one-time passcode that remains valid until you refresh that URL to
      obtain a new passcode, or you use the passcode with <code>get_token</code> to generate an
      access token.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Send a request to the management API, as the following example shows:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8" \
      -H "accept: application/json;charset=utf-8" \
      -H "Authorization: Basic ZWRnZWNsaTplZGdlY2xpc2VjcmV0" -X POST \
      https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com/oauth/token -s \
      -d 'grant_type=password&amp;response_type=token<strong>&amp;passcode=<var>passcode</var></strong>'</pre>
      <p>The <var>passcode</var> acts as your credentials for authorization.</p>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The body of the request contains the following:
          <ul>
            <li><code>grant_type</code> is "password"</li>
            <li><code>response_type</code> is "token"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>passcode</code> is the passcode you got in the previous step</li>
        <li>The <code>Authorization</code> header is "Basic ZWRnZWNsaTplZGdlY2xpc2VjcmV0" (use this
          exact value)</li>
        <li>The request type is <code>POST</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The call prints the access and refresh tokens to the screen.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>To refresh your access token:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>In a browser, go to the following URL to obtain a one-time passcode:
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com/passcode</pre>
      <p>For example, for a zone named "acme", go to the following URL:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://acme.login.apigee.com/passcode</pre>
      <p>The passcode essentially acts as your credentials to get your tokens.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Submit a request to <code>https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com/oauth/token</code>,
      as the following example shows:
      <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8" \
  -H "Accept: application/json;charset=utf-8" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic ZWRnZWNsaTplZGdlY2xpc2VjcmV0" -X POST \
  https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com/oauth/token \
  -d 'grant_type=refresh_token&amp;refresh_token=<var>REFRESH_TOKEN</var>'</pre>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The body of the request contains the following:
          <ul>
            <li><code>grant_type</code> is "refresh_token"</li>
            <li><code>refresh_token</code> is the value of the refresh token (if you used
            {{get_token}}, then the refresh token is in <code>~/.sso-cli</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <code>Authorization</code> header is "Basic ZWRnZWNsaTplZGdlY2xpc2VjcmV0" (use this
          exact value)</li>
        <li>The request type is <code>POST</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h2>Access the management API with SAML</h2>

  <p>You can use tools such as <code>curl</code> or the Apigee convenience utility {{acurl}} to
  access the management API.</p>

  <p>With <code>curl</code>, you call the management API and pass the access token in the
  <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> header, as the following example shows:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl <strong>-H "Authorization: Bearer <var>ACCESS_TOKEN</var>"</strong>
  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/ahamilton-eval</pre>

  <p>With <code>acurl</code>, you do not need to specify the <code>Authorization</code> header once
  you have called {{get_token}} and saved the tokens locally. For example:</p>

  <pre class="devsite-terminal">acurl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/ahamilton-eval</pre>

  <p>These examples call a management API endpoint that gets details about the given organization.
  For a complete list of management API endpoints, see {{apiref}}.</p>

  <p>For additional methods of calling the API, including ways to ensure that your token remains
  fresh, see <a href="using-oauth2#access-api">Access the management API with OAuth2</a>.</p>
