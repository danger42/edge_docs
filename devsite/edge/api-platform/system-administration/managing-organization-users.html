  <p>This topic explains how to create and manage organization users. You must be an organization
  administrator to perform these tasks.</p>

  <h2 id="whatareorganizationusers">What are organization users?</h2>

  <p>Organization users are given explicit permission by the organization administrator to create,
  read, edit, and/or delete entities in an Apigee Edge organization. Permissions are role-based,
  where a role conveys a specific, targeted set of permissions. This permission scheme is also
  called <strong>role-based access control</strong>, or RBAC for short.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> Organization users are typically members of your API team who develop and test
    APIs, run reports, and perform other API admin tasks. Do not confuse organization users with
    app developers, the consumers of your APIs. The process of onboarding app developers and
    managing their access to your APIs is an entirely separate topic. See <a href=
    "/api-platform/publish/publishing-overview.html">Introduction to publishing</a>.

    <p>Also, note that topic applies to API management, not API BaaS, which has its own user
    management framework.</p>
  </aside>

  <h2 id="whatedgeentitiesdoorganizationusersworkwith">What Edge entities do organization users
  work with?</h2>

  <p>Organization users interact with a number of entities, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>API proxies</li>

    <li>API products</li>

    <li>Developer apps</li>

    <li>Developers</li>

    <li>Environments (Trace tool sessions and deployments)</li>

    <li>Custom reports (Analytics)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The degree of interaction permitted depends on the role or roles that are assigned to the user
  by the organization administrator. See also <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/understanding-roles.html">Assigning roles</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="viewingusers"><a name="view" id="view"></a>Viewing users</h2>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> You must be an Apigee Edge organization administrator to create
  users and assign roles. Only organization administrators can see and use the Admin menu used to
  manage organization users.</aside>

  <p>In the <strong>New Edge experience</strong>, you view organization users by
  selecting <strong>Admin &gt; Users</strong>.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/admin-users.png"></p>

  <p>In <strong>Classic Edge</strong>, you view organization users by
  selecting <strong>Admin &gt; Organization Users</strong>. </p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/admin_menu.png"></p>

  <p>For each user, you can view:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the user you entered when you created the
    user.</li>

    <li><strong>Primary email:</strong> The email address you entered when you created the
    user.</li>

    <li><strong>Role:</strong> The role of the user, which determines the degree of access. By
    default, all users have a user role that gives them full access to all features in
    Apigee. See also <a href=
    "/api-platform/system-administration/understanding-roles.html">Assigning roles</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="addingusers"><a name="add" id="add"></a>Adding users</h2>

  <p>To add an organization user:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to the Edge management UI as an organization administrator.</li>

    <li>Select <strong>Admin &gt; Users</strong>.<br>
    If you are not an organization administrator, this menu does not appear. </li>

    <li>Click <strong>+ User</strong>. The "Add a User" screen appears.</li>

    <li>Enter the user's email address.</li>

    <li>Select the roles you want to assign to the user.<br>
    You can add more than one role to a user. </li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If the user already has an Apigee account, they will see the new organization after logging
  into Apigee Edge. If the new user doesn't yet have an Apigee account, they are sent email
  instructions for account activation, password reset, and logging in. </p>

  <h2 id="editingauserprofileandassignedroles"><a id="AddMultipleRoles" name=
  "AddMultipleRoles"></a>Editing a user profile and assigned roles</h2>

  <p>You can edit a user profile and add one or more roles to a user when you create a new user or
  edit an existing user. See also <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/understanding-roles.html">Assigning roles</a>. </p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If a user has multiple roles assigned, the highest-level
  permission takes precedence. For example, if one role doesn't allow the user to create API
  proxies, but another role does, then the user can create API proxies. In general, it is not a
  common use case to assign users multiple roles.</aside>

  <p>To edit a user profile and assigned roles:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Admin &gt; Users</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click the name of an existing user.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li>You can modify only your own first and last name, not those of other users.</li>

    <li>Add or remove roles:

      <ul>
        <li>To add a role, click in the <strong>Roles</strong> field and select a new role from the
        drop-down.</li>

        <li>To remove a role, click the x associated with the role.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Repeat the previous step to add additional roles, if desired.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="removingusersfromanorganization"><a name="delete" id="delete"></a>Removing users from an
  organization</h2>

  <p>To remove a user from an organization, you must be an organization administrator. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Admin &gt; Users</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Remove</strong> in the Actions column associated with the user that you want
    to remove.</li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> This removes the user from the current organization only. If the
  user is a member of multiple organizations, they remain in the system.</aside>

  <p>To remove a user from Apigee completely, contact <a href=
