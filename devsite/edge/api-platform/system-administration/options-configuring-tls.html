  <p>This document contains an overview of how you configure TLS on Edge for two functional
  areas:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Access to your API proxies by API clients. Use <strong>virtual hosts</strong> on the Edge
    Router to configure TLS.</li>

    <li>Access to your backend services by Edge. Use <strong>target endpoints and target
    servers</strong> on the Edge Message Processor to configure TLS.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Both of these access types are shown below:</p>

  <h2 id="about-setting-tls-options-in-a-virtual-host-or-target-endpoint-target-server">About
  setting TLS options in a virtual host or target endpoint/target server</h2>

  <p>A virtual host can be represented by an XML object, in the form:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;VirtualHost name="secure"&gt;
    ...
<strong>    &lt;SSLInfo&gt; 
        &lt;Enabled&gt;true&lt;/Enabled&gt; 
        &lt;ClientAuthEnabled&gt;true&lt;/ClientAuthEnabled&gt; 
        &lt;KeyStore&gt;ref://myKeystoreRef&lt;/KeyStore&gt; 
        &lt;KeyAlias&gt;myKeyAlias&lt;/KeyAlias&gt; 
        &lt;TrustStore&gt;ref://myTruststoreRef&lt;/TrustStore&gt; 
        &lt;IgnoreValidationErrors&gt;false&lt;/IgnoreValidationErrors&gt;
    &lt;/SSLInfo&gt;
</strong>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The area of the virtual host that a you modify to configure TLS is defined by the <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&lt;SSLInfo&gt;</span> tag. You use the
  same <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&lt;SSLInfo&gt;</span> tag to configure a
  target endpoint or target server.</p>

  <p>The following table describes the TLS configuration elements used by the <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&lt;SSLInfo&gt;</span> tag:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>

        Target Servers and Target Endpoints, and when configuring virtual hosts that use 2-way
          TLS.</p>

        <p>When used with a target endpoint/target server, if the backend system uses SNI and returns a cert
          with a subject Distinguished Name (DN) that does not match the hostname, there is no way
          to ignore the error and the connection fails.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2 id="about-setting-the-&lt;keystore&gt;-and-&lt;truststore&gt;-elements">About setting the
  &lt;KeyStore&gt; and &lt;TrustStore&gt; elements</h2>

  <p>In the virtual host example above, the keystore and truststore are specified by using
  <strong>references</strong>, in the form:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;KeyStore&gt;<strong>ref://myKeystoreRef</strong>&lt;/KeyStore&gt;
&lt;TrustStore&gt;<strong>ref://myTruststoreRef</strong>&lt;/TrustStore&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Apigee strongly recommends that you always use references to the keystore and truststore. A
  reference is a variable that contains the name of the keystore or truststore, rather than
  specifying the keystore name directly. In this example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><code>myKeystoreRef</code></strong> is a reference that contains the name of the
    keystore. In this example, the name of the keystore is <strong>myKeystore</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong><code>myTruststoreRef</code></strong> is a reference that contains the name of the
    truststore. In this example, the name of the truststore is <strong>myTruststore</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When a cert expires, you have to update the virtual host or target endpoint/target server to
  specify the keystore or truststore containing the new cert. The advantage to a reference is that
  you can modify the value of the reference to change the keystore or truststore without having to
  modify the virtual host or target endpoint/target server itself:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>For Cloud customers</strong>: Changing the value of the reference does not require
    you to contact <a href="https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee
    support</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>For Private Cloud customers</strong>: Changing the value of the reference does not
    require you to restart Edge components, such as Routers and Message Processors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alternatively, you can specify the keystore name and truststore name directly:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;KeyStore&gt;<strong>myKeystore</strong>&lt;/KeyStore&gt;
&lt;TrustStore&gt;<strong>myTruststore</strong>&lt;/TrustStore&gt; 
</pre>

  <p>If you directly specify the name of the keystore or truststore, then Cloud customers must
  contact <a href="https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee support</a>
  and Private Cloud customers must restart certain Edge components to update the cert.</p>

  <p>A third option, for target endpoints/target server only, is to use flow variables:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;KeyStore&gt;{<strong>ssl.keystore</strong>}&lt;/KeyStore&gt;
&lt;TrustStore&gt;{<strong>ssl.truststore</strong>}&lt;/TrustStore&gt; 
</pre>

  <p>Flow variables work for target endpoints/target servers and let you update the keystore or
  truststore like references. However, they do not work with virtual hosts, and require you to pass
  information about the keystore, alias, and truststore on every request.</p>

  <h3 id="restrictions-in-using-references-to-keystores-and-truststore">Restrictions in using
  references to keystores and truststore</h3>

  <p>Paid Cloud customers and all Private Cloud customers configuring TLS must take into account
  the following restriction when using references to keystores and truststores:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can only use keystore and truststore references in virtual hosts if you terminate TLS
    on the Apigee Routers.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have a load balancer in front of the Apigee Routers, and you terminate TLS on the
    load balancer, then you cannot use keystore and truststore references in virtual hosts. Please
    contact <a href="https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee
    Support</a> to configure TLS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id=
  "aboutsettingthekeystoreandtruststoreelements-ifyourexistingvirtualhostusesaliteralkeystoreortruststorename">
  If your existing virtual host uses a literal keystore or truststore name</h3>

  <p>Existing virtual hosts on Edge might not be configured to use references for keystores and
  truststores. In this case, you can update the virtual host to use a reference.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Edge for the Cloud</strong><br>
    To change the virtual host to use a reference to the keystore you must work with <a href=
    "https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support">Apigee Support</a>.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Edge for the Private Cloud</strong><br>
      To convert the virtual host to use a reference:

      <ol>
        <li>Update the virtual host to use a reference.</li>

        <li>Restart the Routers. See <a href=

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="about-configuring-tls">About configuring TLS</h2>

  <p>Two main factors determine how you perform TLS configuration:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Are you an Edge Cloud or Private Cloud customer?</li>

    <li>How are you going to update expired or expiring certs?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="cloud-and-private-cloud-configuration-options">Cloud and Private Cloud configuration
  options</h3>

  <p>The following table shows the different configuration options for Cloud and Private Cloud
  customers:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th> </th>

        <th><strong>Private Cloud</strong></th>

        <th><strong>Cloud</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Virtual host</strong></td>

        <td>Complete control</td>

        <td>Complete control for paid accounts only</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Target endpoint/target server</strong></td>

        <td>Complete control</td>

        <td>Complete control</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Private Cloud customers have complete control over the configuration of both virtual hosts and
  target endpoints/target servers. That control includes the ability to create and delete virtual
  hosts, and set all properties on a virtual host.</p>

  <p>All Cloud customers, both paid and trial, have complete control over the configuration of
  target endpoints/target servers. In addition, paid Cloud customers have complete control of
  virtual hosts, including TLS properties.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Trial customers do not have the ability to configure a virtual
  host. Instead, Apigee automatically provides a TLS certificate and private key to support HTTPS
  on a secure virtual host so that trial customers can get started developing and testing
  APIs.</aside>

  <h3 id="handling-expired-certificates">Handling expired certificates</h3>

  <p>If a TLS certificate expires, or if your system configuration changes such that the
  certificate is no longer valid, then you need to update the certificate. When configuring TLS for
  a virtual host or target endpoint/target server, you should decide how you are going to perform
  that update before you perform any configuration.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> You cannot update an existing keystore or truststore to add a
  new certificate. You must create a new keystore/truststore when updating a certificate.
  Typically, you create the new keystore/truststore and upload the new cert before the cert in the
  old keystore/truststore expires. This lets you test the new keystore/truststore and rollback to
  the old keystore/truststore if there are any issues.</aside>

  <h3 id="when-a-cert-expires">When a cert expires</h3>

  <p>On Edge, you store certs in one of two places:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keystore</strong> - Contains the TLS certificate and private key used to identify
    the entity during TLS handshaking.</li>

    <li><strong>Truststore</strong> - Contains trusted certificates on an TLS client used to
    validate a TLS server's certificate presented to the client. These certificates are typically
    self-signed certificates, certificates signed by a trusted CA, or certs used as part of two-way
    TLS.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>When a cert in a keystore expires, and you are using a reference to the
  keystore</strong>, you cannot upload a new cert to the keystore. Instead, you:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a new keystore.</li>

    <li>Upload the new cert to the new keystore <strong>using the same alias name</strong> as in
    the old keystore.</li>

    <li>Update the reference in your virtual host or target server/target endpoint to use the new
    keystore.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>When a cert in a truststore expires, and you are using a reference to the
  truststore</strong>, you:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a new truststore.</li>

    <li>Upload the new cert to the new truststore. The alias name does not matter for truststores.
    <strong>Note</strong>: If a cert is part of a chain, then you must either create a single file
    containing all the certs and upload that file to a single alias, or upload all certs in the
    chain separately to the truststore using a different alias for each cert.</li>

    <li>Update the reference in your virtual host or target server/target endpoint to use the new
    truststore.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="summary-of-methods-of-updating-an-expired-cert">Summary of methods of updating an expired
  cert</h3>

  <p>The method that you use to specify the name of the keystore and truststore in the virtual host
  or target endpoint/target server determines how you perform the cert update. You can use:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>References</li>

    <li>Direct names</li>

    <li>Flow variables</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these methods has different repercussions on the update process, as described in the
  following table. As you can see, references provide the greatest flexibility for both Cloud and
  Private Cloud customers:</p>
