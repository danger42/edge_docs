  <p>SAML supports a single sign-on (SSO) environment. By using SAML with Edge, you can support SSO
  for the Edge UI and API in addition to any other services that you provide and that also support
  SAML.</p>

  <h2>Advantages of SAML authentication</h2>

  <p>SAML authentication offers several advantages. By using SAML you can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Take full control of user management:</strong> When users leave your organization
      and are deprovisioned centrally, they are automatically denied access to Edge.</li>
    <li><strong>Control how users authenticate to access Edge:</strong> You can choose different
      authentication types for different Edge organizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Control authentication policies:</strong> Your SAML provider may support
      authentication policies that are more in line with your enterprise standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor logins, logouts, unsuccessful login attempts and high risk activities</strong>
      on your Edge deployment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that SAML is only used for authentication by the Edge UI and Edge management API.
  Authorization is still controlled by Edge user roles. See <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/understanding-roles">Assigning roles</a> for more.</p>

  <p>SAML is supported as the authentication mechanism for the Cloud version of Edge and for Edge
  for the Private Cloud version 4.17.09 and later.</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>Before you decide to use SAML, you should consider the following requirements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Existing users:</strong> You must add all existing organization users to the SAML
      identity provider</li>
    <li><strong>Portal:</strong> If you are using a Developer Services portal, the portal uses OAuth
      to access Edge</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Auth will be disabled:</strong> You will need to remove Basic Auth from all of
      your scripts</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth and SAML must be kept separate:</strong> If you use both OAuth2 and SAML, you
      must use separate terminal sessions for your OAuth2 flow and SAML flow.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="using-saml">SAML and identity zones</h2>

  <p>You enable SAML at the organization level through Edge identity zones. That means every
  organization that supports SAML authentication must be added to an Edge identity zone.</p>

  <p>An <em>Edge identity zone</em> is an authentication realm that defines a SAML identity provider
  used for authentication. Only when a user authenticates with the identity provider can they access
  the Edge organizations and resources scoped to the zone.</p>

  <p>For more information, see <a href="using-saml#identity">Using an identity zone with SAML</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ui">Using SAML with the Edge UI</h2>

  <p>The SAML specification defines three entities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Principal (Edge UI user)</li>
    <li>Service provider (Edge SSO) </li>
    <li>Identity provider (returns SAML assertion)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When SAML is enabled, the principal (an Edge UI user) requests access to the service provider
  (Edge SSO). Edge SSO (in it's role as a SAML service provider) then requests and obtains an
  identity assertion from the SAML identity provider and uses that assertion to create the OAuth2
  token required to access the Edge UI. The user is then redirected to the Edge UI.</p>

  <p>This process is shown below:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/private-cloud/images/saml_v3.png"></p>

  <p>In this diagram:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>User attempts to access the Edge UI by making a request to the login domain for the Edge
      SSO, which includes the zone name. For example,
      <code>https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com</code>
    </li>
    <li>Unauthenticated requests to <code>https://<var>zoneName</var>.login.apigee.com</code>
    are redirected to the customer's SAML identity provider. For example,
    <code>https://idp.customer.com</code>.</li>
    <li>If customer is not logged in to the identity provider, the customer is prompted to log
    in.</li>
    <li>The user is authenticated by the SAML identity provider. The SAML identity provider
    generates and returns a SAML 2.0 assertion to the Edge SSO.</li>
    <li>Edge SSO validates the assertion, extracts the user identity from the assertion, generates
      the OAuth 2 authentication token for the Edge UI, and redirects the user to the main Edge UI
      page at:
      <pre class="prettyprint">https://<var>zoneName</var>.enterprise.apigee.com/platform/<var>orgName</var></pre>
      <p>Where <var>orgName</var> is the name of an Edge organization.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
