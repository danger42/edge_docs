  <p>Apigee Edge provides the following safeguards for securing global user passwords.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lockout after 5 failed attempts</strong>: After 5 failed login attempts, users are
    locked out for 120 seconds before they can try logging in again.</li>

    <li><strong>Password expiration</strong>: There is no password expiration for non-PCI (Payment
    Card Industry) organizations. This is also the default in an Apigee Edge for Private Cloud
    installation. For PCI-enabled organizations, passwords expire after 90 days. No advance
    notifications are sent when passwords are close to expiring.</li>

    <li><strong>Password reset</strong>: Global users can use the "Forgot Password" functionality
    on the Edge UI login page to reset their passwords.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Private Cloud:</b> In Apigee Edge for Private Cloud, you can modify
  password security behavior. For more information, see <a href=
  "/private-cloud/latest/resetting-passwords.html">Resetting Edge Passwords</a>.</aside>
