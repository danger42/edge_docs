  <p>The Edge UI and Edge management API operate by making requests to the Edge Management Server,
  where the Management Server supports the following types of authentication:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Auth and Basic Auth with two-factor authentication</strong><br/>
      Log in to the Edge UI or make requests to the Edge management API by passing your username and
      password. If two-factor authentication is enabled, you also pass a six digit Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) code when logging in to the Edge UI.</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth2</strong><br/>
      Exchange your Edge Basic Auth credentials for an OAuth2 access token and refresh token.
      Make calls to the Edge management API by passing the OAuth2 access token in the Bearer
      header of an API call.
      <p>See <a href="/api-services/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api">Using
      OAuth2 security with the Apigee Edge management API</a> for more.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Edge also supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 as the authentication
  mechanism. With SAML enabled, access to the Edge UI and Edge management API still uses OAuth2
  access tokens. However, now you can generate these tokens from SAML assertions returned by an
  identity provider.</p>
