  <p>The method that you use to specify the name of the keystore and truststore in the virtual host
  or target endpoint/target server determines how you perform the cert update. You can specify the
  name of the keystore and truststore by using:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>References - <strong>preferred</strong></li>
    <li>Direct names</li>
    <li>Flow variables</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these methods has different repercussions on the cert update process, as described in
  the following table.</p>

  <h2 id="testing-the-cert-before-and-after-the-update">Testing the cert before and after the
  update</h2>

  <p>Use the following <code>openssl</code> commands to test the current cert before you update
  it:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal">echo | openssl s_client -servername <em><strong>hostAlias</strong></em> -connect <em><strong>hostAlias</strong></em>.apigee.net:443 2&gt;/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject
</pre>

  <p>Where <strong><em>hostAlias</em></strong> the host alias of the virtual host or IP address.
  For example:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal">echo | openssl s_client -servername <em><strong>api.myCompany.com</strong></em> -connect <em><strong>api.myCompany.com</strong></em>:443 2&gt;/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject
</pre>

  <p>You should see output in the form:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
notBefore=Dec 30 22:11:38 2015 GMT
notAfter=Dec 30 22:11:38 2016 GMT
subject= /OU=Domain Control Validated/CN=*.apigee.net
</pre>

  <p>Use the same command after you update the cert to test it.</p>

  <h2 id="update-a-tls-certificate-in-a-keystore">Update a TLS certificate in a keystore</h2>

  <p>For an on-premises deployment of Edge:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a new keystore and upload a cert and key as described at
      <a href="keystores-and-truststores">Keystores and Truststores</a>.

    In the new keystore, ensure that you use the same same for the key alias as was used in the
    existing key store.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: You can delete the current keystore and create a new one with the same
    name and alias. No Router restart necessary. However, API requests fail until the new keystore
    and alias are set.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>For a virtual host</strong> used by an inbound connections, meaning an API request
      into Edge:

      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha outside">
        <li>If your virtual host uses a reference to the keystore, update the reference as
        described in <a href="working-references">Working
        with references</a>.</li>

        <li>If your virtual host uses a direct name of the keystore:

          <ol>
            <li>Update any virtual hosts that referenced the old keystore and key alias to
            reference the new keystore and key alias.</li>

            <li>Restart the Routers, one at a time. Note that if you deleted the old keystore and
            created a new keystore with the same name, then no Router restart is necessary.<br>
            <br>
            No proxy redeployment required.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>For a target endpoint/target server</strong> used by an outbound connections, meaning
      from Apigee to a backend server:

      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha outside">
        <li>If the target endpoint/target server uses a references to the keystore, update the
        reference as described in <a href="working-references">Working with references</a>.
        No proxy redeployment is necessary.</li>

        <li>If the target endpoint/target server uses a flow variable, update the flow variable. No
        proxy redeployment is necessary.</li>

        <li>If the target endpoint/target server uses a direct name of the keystore:

          <ol>
            <li>Update the target endpoint/target server configuration for any API proxies that
            referenced the old keystore and key alias to reference the new keystore and key
            alias.</li>

            <li>For any API proxies that reference the keystore from a TargetEndpoint definition,
            you must redeploy the proxy.<br>
            <br>
            If the TargetEndpoint references a TargetServer definition, and the TargetServer
            definition references the keystore, then no proxy redeployment is necessary.</li>

            <li>If the keystore is used for two-way TLS between Edge and the backend service, and
            you deleted/recreated the keystore with the same name, you must restart the Edge
            Message Processors.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>After you have confirmed that your new keystore is working correctly, delete the old
    keystore with the expired cert and key as described above.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="update-a-tls-certificate-in-a-truststore">Update a TLS certificate in a truststore</h2>

  <p>If you are using references to the truststore, the process of updating a cert in a truststore
  is the same as for a keystore as shown above. The only differences are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you upload the new cert to the new truststore the alias name does not matter for
    truststores.</li>

    <li>If a cert is part of a chain, then you must either create a single file containing all the
    certs and upload that file to a single alias, or upload all certs in the chain separately to
    the truststore using a different alias for each cert.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you are using direct names of your keystores and truststores:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Upload a new cert to the truststore as described in
      <a href="keystores-and-truststores">Keystores and Truststores</a>.
      There is no need to delete the old cert.</li>

    <li><strong>For a virtual host</strong> used by an inbound connections, meaning an API request
    into Edge, restart the Routers one at a time.</li>

    <li><strong>For a target endpoint/target server</strong> used by an outbound connections,
    meaning from Apigee to a backend server, restart the Edge Message Processors one at a
    time.</li>

    <li>Confirm that your new truststore is working correctly.</li>
