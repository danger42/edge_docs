<p>The following example modifies an existing response object by adding a header to it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">{% includecode content_path="api-platform/reference/policies/examples/assign-message/modify-response.xml" %}</pre>

<p>This example does not create a new message. Instead, it modifies an
existing response message by adding an HTTP header.

<p>Because this example omits a variable name in the {{am_assignto_link}} element, and specifies
<code>type</code> as "response", this policy modifies the response object returned by the target
server.</p>

<p>The HTTP header added to the response message by this policy is derived from a variable
populated by the {{lookup_cache_policy}}. Therefore the response message modified by this
Assign Message policy contains an HTTP header that indicates whether the results have been
pulled from the cache or not. Setting headers in the response can be handy for debugging and
troubleshooting.</p>

<aside class="key-point">
<h3 class="hide-from-toc">TIP</h3>
This pattern of setting headers for debugging and
troubleshooting is a common practice. You can see what header value was sent back by
inspecting the response with the Trace tool or other means.</aside>
