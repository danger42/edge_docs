{% block title %}About Core Persistence Services (CPS){% endblock %}
{% block body %}

<p>Like many of our customers, Apigee has embraced a microservices-based architecture, and this
has improved the reliability and scalability of our products, as well as the way we develop
and deliver them. As part of that effort, we're rolling out our next generation Core Persistence
Services (CPS) in a limited fashion, and new customers will begin to use these new management APIs.
Eventually, all customers will be on CPS. If your organization has CPS enabled, a property
called <code>features.isCpsEnabled</code> is set on your org. To view organization-level
  properties, call the
<a href="https://apidocs.apigee.com/management/apis/get/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D" class="external">Get
Organization API</a> with your Apigee account credentials.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>curl</code> version:</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -v 'https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/<var>org_name</var>'
  -u <var>your_account_email_address</var></pre>

<p>The response for CPS-enabled organizations will contain the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">{
  "name" : "features.isCpsEnabled",
  "value" : "true"
}</pre>

<p>The CPS microservices limited rollout is currently available to select new Edge cloud customers.
Eventually, the new architecture will be used for all Edge cloud and Private Cloud customers.</p>
