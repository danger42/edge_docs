  <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">There are several concepts that are common ideas with a unique
  meaning in Apigee.</span></p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Term</th>

        <th>Definition</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><a name="API_def" id="API_def"></a>API</td>

        <td>A proxy that acts as a facade for your existing API. Rather than calling your existing
        API, developers begin calling the new API generated by Apigee. This facade decouples your
        public interface from your backend API, shielding developers from backend changes, while
        enabling you to innovate at the edge without impacting your internal development teams. As
        you make backend changes, developers continue to call the same API uninterrupted. In more
        advanced scenarios, Apigee lets you expose multiple interfaces to the same API, freeing you
        to customize the signature of an API to meet the needs of various developer niches
        simultaneously.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a name="basepath_def" id="basepath_def"></a>API base path and resources</td>

        <td>An API is made up of base path and a set of resources (also known as <a href=
        "#respath_def">resource paths</a>). For each API, you define a single root URL and multiple
        resource paths. You can think of an API simply as a set of URIs, all of which share a
        common base path. To make it easier to manage your APIs, Apigee augments these raw URIs
        with display names and descriptions.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a name="product_def" id="product_def"></a>API product</td>

        <td>A collection of API resources (URIs) combined with a service plan and presented to
        developers as a bundle. The API product can also include some metadata specific to your
        business for monitoring or analytics. One or more resources can be monetized by including
        them in an API product, which can then bundled into an API package for monetization.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a name="package_def" id="package_def"></a>API package</td>

        <td>A collection of API products that are presented to developers as a bundle, and
        typically associated with a rate plan.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a name="apps_def" id="apps_def"></a>apps</td>

        <td>Your developers use apps to access the resources in your API products. When you create
        an app, you select the API product to include, and Apigee generates a key. Each app has a
        single key that provides access to multiple API products. Apps allow you to control who can
        access your resources. You can control who has access to your API products by revoking and
        refreshing an app's key. And you can control access to bundles of resources by revoking or
        deleting access to the products in an app.</td>

        <td>In commercial law, a person who is authorized to act on behalf of another (called the
        principal) to create a legal relationship with a third party. In monetization, a tax model
        can be set up for a shared revenue plan such that the API provider acts as a disclosed
        agent of the developer to collect revenue (and possibly sales taxes) on behalf of the

        <td>A runtime execution context for APIs. An API must be deployed to an environment before
        it can be accessed at runtime. By default, Apigee organizations are provisioned with two
        environments: 'test' and 'prod'. The 'test' environment is typically used for deploying
        APIs undergoing testing. The 'prod' environment is typically used for deploying APIs for
        production use.</td>

        information, masking sensitive data from external users, examining message contents for
        potential threats, caching common responses to improve performance, and so on. Policies may
        be conditionally executed based on the content or context of a request or response message.
        For example, a transformation policy may be executed to customize a response format if the
        request message was sent from a smartphone.</td>
