      <ul>
        <li>Generate an Edge API proxy from a WSDL file.</li>

        <li>Know the difference between a RESTful SOAP proxy type and a pass-through SOAP

      <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to put an Edge API proxy in front of a SOAP-based web
      service.</p>

      <p>This tutorial illustrates how to generate a new RESTful API in front of your SOAP-based
      service. Though it's not described in detail here, you can also generate a pass-through proxy
      that accepts a SOAP payload and passes it to the backend service.</p>

      <p>Here, you'll have Edge generate the proxy that will sit in front of a SOAP service.</p>

      <div class="tutorial-sidebar">
        <p><strong>RESTful API or SOAP Pass-through?</strong></p>

        <p>The <em>REST-SOAP-REST</em> proxy type generates a new RESTful API with a translation
        layer to SOAP. Clients call it as they would other RESTful services, passing the query
        parameters needed by the backend service. Edge translates this into the SOAP payload
        expected by the service.</p>

        <p>In contrast, with a <em>pass-through proxy</em>, clients simply pass in a SOAP payload.
        This is a way to have SOAP service calls benefit from Edge management features.</p>
      </div>

      <ol>
        <li>Go to the Edge management UI for the organization you'll be working in. For Edge cloud,
        go to <a href="https://enterprise.apigee.com">https://enterprise.apigee.com</a>, log in,
        and select the organization you want to work in.</li>

        <li>On the main menu, click <strong>APIs &gt; API Proxies</strong>, then click the
        <strong>+ API Proxy</strong> button.</li>

        <li>In the Build a Proxy wizard, select <strong>SOAP service</strong>.</li>

                <th>In this field</th>

                  <p>Once you select the proxy type, Edge displays the list of operations for which
                  it will generate REST API paths, as shown here. This list gives you a chance to
                  select from among the operations found in the WSDL (in case you have a particular
                  set you're looking for). Notice that the table also displays resources that a
                  REST client can use to call the backend SOAP service.</p>

                  <p>For now, just leave the first set of operations selected.</p>

        <li>In the Build page, accept the defaults and click <strong>Build and Deploy</strong> to
        have Edge start generating the proxy.

          <p>Edge generates a RESTful API proxy. From the WSDL, it determines the service's
          supported operations, input parameters, and so on. Edge suggests which HTTP method to use
          for each operation. Typically, Edge translates operations into GET requests, which have
          the advantage of being cacheable. Edge also sets up the backend target endpoint, which
          can vary per SOAP operation.</p>

          <p>Unless you're customizing the new proxy (and you aren't in this tutorial), that's all
          there is to it. You can move on to testing the new proxy.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you'd chosen the pass-through SOAP type, Edge would have
      displayed a list of operations with the SOAP payloads that clients would be expected to
      pass.</aside>
    </div>

    <div class="tutorial-section">
      <h2 id="testingtheproxy">Testing the proxy</h2>

      <p>To try out the proxy you've created, open a command prompt and use cURL. Type the command
      below, where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ORG is the name of the Edge organization in which you created the proxy.</li>

        <li>ENV is the environment the proxy is deployed to.</li>

        <li>DOMAIN corresponds to the Edge instance you're using.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl "https://{ORG}-{ENV}.{DOMAIN}/delayedstockquote/quote?StockSymbol=GOOG&amp;LicenseKey=0"
</pre>

      <p>For example, if your organization is <code>docfood</code>, environment is
      <code>test</code>, and you're using the Edge enterprise cloud, you'd run a command like
      this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
curl "https://docfood-test.apigee.net/delayedstockquote/quote?StockSymbol=GOOG&amp;LicenseKey=0"
</pre>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The <code>LicenseKey</code> query parameter value is a
      dummy/test value for the service.</aside>

      <p>If you entered <code>GOOG</code> for the StockSymbol query parameter, you should get
      the current price for Alphabet Inc. Class C stock. For example:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
{  
   "GetQuoteResponse":{  
      "GetQuoteResult":{  
         "StockSymbol":"GOOG",
         "LastTradeAmount":819.55,
         "LastTradeDateTime":"2017-02-13T14:33:00",
         "StockChange":5.88,
         "OpenAmount":816.0,
         "DayHigh":820.96,
         "DayLow":815.49,
         "StockVolume":785064,
         "PrevCls":813.67,
         "ChangePercent":"+0.72%",
         "FiftyTwoWeekRange":"663.28 - 841.95",

      <h2 id="gettheautogeneratedopenapispecification">Get the auto-generated OpenAPI
      Specification</h2>

      <p>When you proxy a SOAP service using "REST to SOAP to REST," Edge automatically generates
      an <a href="https://openapis.org/" target="_blank">OpenAPI Specification</a>. You can use the
      OpenAPI Spec to generate API documentation for the API.</p>

      <p>To get the OpenAPI Spec, simply visit this URL:</p>

      <h2 id="extracredithowdoyoufindoutwhichresourceverbandqueryparameterstouse">Extra credit: How
      do you find out which resource, verb, and query parameters to use?</h2>

      <p>In the test API call, you used a specific resource and query parameters in your cURL call
      to the backend SOAP service. But how would you find that out on your own?</p>

      <h3 id="extracredithowdoyoufindoutwhichresourceverbandqueryparameterstouse-resourceandverb">
      Resource and verb</h3>

      <p>In the API proxy wizard when you were creating the proxy, you saw how the SOAP operations
      would map to API verbs and resources. But if you didn't write those down, here's how you'd
      find out after the proxy is created.</p>

      <p>On the API proxy's <strong>Develop</strong> tab, in the left Navigator pane you'll see a
      list of flows under the Proxy Endpoints. Click the flow you're interested in. For example,
      the <strong>GetQuote</strong> flow is a good candidate. Then view the XML in the Code pane,
      which shows the resource path and verb for the flow in the &lt;Condition&gt; element:
      <code>/quote</code> and <code>GET</code>.</p>

      <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/tutorial_soap_flow.png"></p>

      <h3 id="extracredithowdoyoufindoutwhichresourceverbandqueryparameterstouse-queryparameters">
      Query parameters</h3>

      <p>With the <strong>GetQuote</strong> flow selected, click the first policy in the graphical
      flow view. It should be an Extract Variables policy that captures query parameters that are
      expected to be passed: <code>StockSymbol</code> and <code>LicenseKey</code>. (If you do a web
      search for the SOAP service, it tells you what to pass for the LicenseKey.)</p>

      <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/tutorial_soap_query_params.png"></p>

      <p>The captured query parameters are saved as variables and used by the next policy to
      construct the SOAP message.</p>
