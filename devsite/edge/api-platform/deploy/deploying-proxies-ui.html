  <p>All organizations in Apigee Edge, by default, have two environments: <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">test</span> and <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">prod</span>. The naming is arbitrary. These
  environments are merely designed to provide you with one area to work on and test API changes,
  and another area where APIs are exposed to apps.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Depending on your role, you may not be able to deploy to all
  environments. Users can only deploy to the <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">test</span> environment. If you're an
  administrator you can deploy to any environment.</aside>

  <h2 id="deploymentoptions"><a name="system" id="system"></a>Deployment options</h2>

  <p>You can deploy proxies as revisions or versions. These are distinct concepts, as explained
  next.</p>

  <h3 id="deploymentoptions-aboutrevisions">About revisions</h3>

  <p>Each environment in an organization can only have one deployed revision of an API proxy. It is
  common to have a proxy revision in <code>prod</code> while another revision is
  in <code>test</code> as it's being tested or developed. For example, you could have
  revision 1 deployed in <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">test</span> and revision 20 deployed
  in <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">prod</span>. You can view
  deployment of all revisions on the Overview page of the API proxy editor.</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/proxy_revisions.png"></p>

  <p>When you create a new revision of an API proxy without changing its base path, then deploy it
  to an environment in which it's already deployed, the previous version is undeployed and the new
  revision is deployed in its place. Note that deployment through the management UI might impact
  inbound calls. To handle and transition inbound calls more gracefully during deployment, use the
  management API. See the section on seamless deployment in <a href=
  "/api-platform/deploy/deploy-api-proxies-using-management-api.html">Deploy API proxies using the
  management API</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="deploymentoptions-aboutversions">About versions</h3>

  <p>Edge supports multiple version deployments of a proxy in a single environment. Each version
  must have a different base path (for example <code>/v1</code> and <code>/v2</code>). </p>

  <h2 id="deploying">Deploying and undeploying an API Proxy</h2>

  <p>{% dynamic include /includes/___proxy-bundle-size-limit-note %}</p>

  <p>To deploy (or undeploy) an API proxy in the management UI:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the API proxy editor, select the revision you want to deploy (or undeploy).</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Deployment &gt; {environment}</strong> and respond to the confirmation
    dialog.

      <p><img src="/api-platform/images/proxy_deploy.png"></p>If the API proxy base path is the
      same as another deployed revision in that environment, the former revision is undeployed and
      the new revision is deployed in its place.<br>
      For deploying multiple versions in the same environment, see the next section.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> You can also undeploy a revision by performing the previous
  steps on an already deployed revision, indicated by a green dot next to the environment
  name.</aside>
