  <p>All organizations in Apigee Edge, by default, have two environments: <code>test</code> and
  <code>prod</code>. The naming is arbitrary. These
  environments are merely designed to provide you with one area to work on and test API changes,
  and another area where APIs are exposed to apps.</p>

  <p>Depending on your role, you may not be able to deploy to all environments. Users can only
  deploy to the <code>test</code> environment. If you're an administrator you can deploy to any
  environment.</p>

  <h2 id="deploymentoptions">Deployment options</h2>

  <p>You can deploy proxies as revisions or versions. These are distinct concepts, as explained
  next.</p>

  <h3 id="deploymentoptions-aboutrevisions">About revisions</h3>

  <p>Each environment in an organization can only have one deployed revision of an API proxy. It is
  common to have a proxy revision in <code>prod</code> while another revision is
  in <code>test</code> as it's being tested or developed. For example, you could have
  revision 1 deployed in <code>test</code> and revision 20 deployed
  in <code>prod</code>. You can view
  deployment of all revisions on the Overview page of the API proxy editor.</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/proxy_revisions.png" class="screenshot"></p>

  <p>When you create a new revision of an API proxy without changing its base path, then deploy it
  to an environment in which it's already deployed, the previous version is undeployed and the new
  revision is deployed in its place. Note that deployment through the management UI might impact
  inbound calls. To handle and transition inbound calls more gracefully during deployment, use the
  management API. See the section on seamless deployment in <a href=
  "/api-platform/deploy/deploy-api-proxies-using-management-api">Deploy API proxies using the
  management API</a>.</p>

  <p>The revisions feature in Apigee Edge is not designed to be used as a source control system.
    Use your existing source code repository and software development life cycle (SDLC) processes
    to manage changes to and retain history for your API proxies. Think of revisions in Edge as
    a way to quickly view or deploy different revisions of an API proxy.
    There is a limit of {{ limit_apiproxy_revisions_per_proxy }} API proxy revisions that can be
    retained in history in Apigee Edge, as documented in the
    <a href="/api-platform/reference/limits">Limits</a> topic. When you reach the limit, you should
    <a href="/api-platform/fundamentals/download-api-proxies">back up</a> and delete older
    revisions you no longer want to retain in history in Apigee Edge before creating new
    revisions.</p>

  <h3 id="deploymentoptions-aboutversions">About versions</h3>

  <p>Edge supports multiple version deployments of a proxy in a single environment. Each version
  must have a different base path (for example <code>/v1</code> and <code>/v2</code>). </p>

<aside class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The size limit of an API proxy bundle is {{ limit_apiproxy_bundle }}.
The size limit is {{ limit_apiproxy_bundle_hosted_targets }} for API proxies using
  the <a href="/api-platform/hosted-targets/hosted-targets-overview">hosted targets</a> feature.</p>
</aside>

  <p>To deploy (or undeploy) an API proxy in the management UI:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the API proxy editor, select the revision you want to deploy (or undeploy).</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Deployment &gt; {environment}</strong> and respond to the confirmation
    dialog.

      <p><img src="/api-platform/images/proxy_deploy.png"></p>If the API proxy base path is the
      same as another deployed revision in that environment, the former revision is undeployed and
      the new revision is deployed in its place.<br>
      For deploying multiple versions in the same environment, see the next section.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> You can also undeploy a revision by performing the previous
  steps on an already deployed revision, indicated by a green dot next to the environment
  name.</aside>
