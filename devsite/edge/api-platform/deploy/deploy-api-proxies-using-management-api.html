  <p>Every organization has a unique software development lifecycle (SDLC). It is often necessary
  to synchronize and align API proxy deployment with the processes used for backend services.</p>

  <p>The Edge management API methods demonstrated in this topic can be used to integrate API proxy
  management into your organization's SDLC. A common usage of this API is to write scripts or code
  that deploy API proxies, or that migrate API proxies from one environment to another, as part of
  a larger automated process that also deploys or migrates other applications.</p>

  <p>The management API makes no assumptions about your SDLC (or anyone else's, for that matter).
  Rather, it exposes atomic functions that can be coordinated by your development team to automate
  and optimize your API development lifecycle.</p>

  <p>All of the management APIs are documented in <a href="/api/apis-0">APIs</a>. This topic
  focuses on the set of APIs that are for managing API proxies.</p>

  <h2 id="interactingwiththeapi">Interacting with the API</h2>The following steps walk you through
  simple interactions with the APIs.

  <h3 id="interactingwiththeapi-listapisinyourorganization">List APIs in your organization</h3>

  <p>You can begin by listing all of the API proxies in your organization. (Remember to substitute
  entries for <code>email:password</code> and <code>{org_name}</code>. For instructions, see
  <a href="/api-platform/reference/apis/api-reference-getting-started.html">API reference getting
  started</a>.</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u email:password https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis
</pre>

  <p>Sample Response:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
[ "weatherapi" ]
</pre>

  <h3 id="interactingwiththeapi-getanapi">Get an API</h3>

  <p>You can call the GET method on any API proxy in your organization. This call returns a list of
  all available revisions of the API proxy.</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u email:password -H "Accept: application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/weatherapi
</pre>

  <p>Sample Response:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "name" : "weatherapi",
  "revision" : [ "1" ]
}
</pre>

  <p>The only detail returned by this method is the name of the API proxy along with the associated
  'revision', which has an associated number. API proxies consist of a bundle of configuration
  files. Revisions provide a lightweight mechanism for managing your updates of the configuration
  as you iterate. Revisions are sequentially numbered, enabling you to revert a change by deploying
  a previous revision of your API proxy. Also, you can deploy a revision of an API proxy into the
  prod environment, while continuing to create new revisions of that API proxy in the test
  environment. When you are ready, you can 'promote' the higher revision of your API proxy from the
  test environment over the prior revision of the API proxy in the prod environment.</p>

  <p>In this example, there is only one revision because the API proxy was just created. As an API
  proxy moves through the lifecycle of iterative configuration and deployment, the revision number
  increments by integers. Using direct API calls to deploy, you can optionally increment the
  revision number of the API proxy. Sometimes when you make minor changes, you might not want to
  increment the revision.</p>

  <h3 id="interactingwiththeapi-getapirevision">Get API Revision</h3>

  <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> Don't confuse the <i>version</i> of an API (that is, the
  public interface) with the <i>revision</i> of an API proxy (that is, the internal number
  associated with a configuration). The two numbers are unrelated, and the revision number of an
  API proxy is totally opaque to apps that consume your API.</aside>

  <p>The API <i>version</i> (for example, <code>api.company.com/v1</code>) should change very
  infrequently. When you do increment the API version, it signifies to developers that there has
  been a significant change in the signature of the external interface exposed by the API.</p>

  <p>The API proxy <i>revision</i> is an incremented number associated with an API proxy
  configuration. API Services maintains revisions of your configurations so that you can revert a
  configuration when something goes wrong. By default, an API proxy's revision is automatically
  incremented every time you import an API proxy by using the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/apis-0">Import a new API Proxy</a> API. If you
  don't want to increment an API proxy's revision, use the <a href=
  "/management/apis/post/organizations/{org_name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}-0">Update
  API Proxy Revision</a> API. If you're using Maven to deploy, use the <code>clean</code> or
  <code>update</code> options, as described in the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin" target="_blank">Maven plugin
  readme</a>.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Best practice:</b> To obtain the detailed profile of an API proxy
  configuration, you call the GET method on a specific revision number.</aside>

  <p>For example, you can call the GET method on API proxy revision 1 to get a detailed view.</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u email:password -H "Accept:application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/weatherapi/revisions/1

  reference</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="interactingwiththeapi-deployinganapitoanenvironment">Deploying an API to an
  environment</h3>

  <p>Once your API proxy is configured to receive and forward requests properly, you can deploy it
  to one or more environments. Usually, you iterate on API proxies in 'test' and then, when ready,
  you 'promote' the API proxy revision to 'prod'. Often, you will find that you have many more
  revisions of an API proxy in the test environment, primarily because you will do much less
  iteration in the prod environment.</p>

  <p>An API proxy cannot be invoked until is has been deployed to an environment. Once you have
  deployed the API proxy revision to prod, you can then publish the 'prod' URL to external
  developers.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> As you've seen, you deploy the API <b>revision</b> to an
  environment, so the first step in deploying API proxy revisions is to verify the list of
  environments in your organization.</aside>

  <h3 id="interactingwiththeapi-howtolistenvironments">How to list environments</h3>

  <p>Every organization in Apigee Edge has at least two environments: 'test' and 'prod'. The
  distinction is arbitrary. The goal is to provide you with an area to verify that your API proxy
  is working properly before you open it up to outside developers.</p>

  <p>Each environment is really just a network address, enabling you segregate traffic between the
  API proxies that you are working on, and those that are being accessed by apps at runtime.</p>

  <p>Environments also provide segregation of data and resources. You can for example, set up
  different caches in test and prod, which can be accessed only by API proxies executing in that
  environment.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you have an on-premises installation of Apigee Edge, you may
  see a different list of environments.</aside>

  <h3 id="interactingwiththeapi-exploredeployments">Explore Deployments</h3>

  <p>A "deployment" is a revision of an API proxy that has been deployed in an environment. An API
  proxy that is in the 'deployed' state is accessible over the network, at the addresses defined in
  the VirtualHost for that environment.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Tip:</b> It is often useful to check to see in which environment (and
  if!) your API is deployed. For example, you might find requests to your API proxy are failing.
  One troubleshooting step is to ensure that the API proxy is deployed as expected.</aside>

  <h2 id="deployingapiproxies">Deploying API proxies</h2>

  <p>API proxies cannot be invoked until they have been deployed. API Services exposes RESTful APIs
  that provide control over the deployment process.</p>

  <aside class="key-point"><b>Best practice:</b> The following APIs are called on your behalf by
  the Python deploy tool. The deploy tool provides support for packaging and importing API proxies
  that you develop locally, and it also manages undeployment of existing API proxy revisions. Use
  the direct API calls described below when you need additional control over the deployment
  process.</aside>

  <p>Only one revision of an API proxy can be deployed in an environment at a given time. Therefore
  the deployed revision needs to be undeployed. You can control whether the new bundle is deployed
  as a new revision or whether it overwrites the existing revision.</p>

  <p>{% dynamic include /includes/___proxy-bundle-size-limit-note %}</p>

  <p>First undeploy the existing revision. Specify the environment name and the revision number of
  the API proxy you want to undeploy:</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -X DELETE \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env-name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments \
-u email:password
</pre>

  <p>Then deploy the new revision. The new revision of the API proxy must already exist: </p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env-name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments \
-u email:password
</pre>

  <aside class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> Using this approach, there will inevitably be some lag
  between the time when the first revision is undeployed and the new revision is deployed. During
  this interval, calls from apps may be rejected with an HTTP code 5xx. If this is a problem, as it
  usually is in production deployments, use the seamless deployment option, described
  below.</aside>

  <h3 id="seamless">Seamless deployment (zero downtime)</h3>

  <p>To minimize the potential for downtime during deployment, use the <code>override</code> option
  on the deployment method, and set it to <code>true</code>.</p>

  <p>You cannot deploy one revision of an API proxy on top of another. The first must always be
  undeployed. By setting <code>override</code> to <code>true</code>, you indicate that one revision
  of an API proxy should be deployed over the currently deployed revision. The result is that the
  deployment sequence is reversed--the new revision is deployed, and once the deployment is
  complete, the already deployed revision is undeployed.</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env-name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments?"override=true" \
-u email:password
</pre>

  <p>You can further optimize deployment by setting the <code>delay</code> parameter. The
  <code>delay</code> parameter specifies a time interval, in seconds, before which the previous
  revision should be undeployed. The effect is that in-flight transactions have a time interval in
  which to complete before the API proxy processing their transaction is undeployed. Following is
  what occurs with <code>override=true</code> and the <code>delay</code> parameter set:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Revision 1 is handling requests.</li>

    <li>Revision 2 is being deployed in parallel.</li>

    <li>When Revision 2 is fully deployed, new traffic is sent to Revision 2. No new traffic is
    sent to Revision 1.</li>

    <li>However, Revision 1 may still be processing existing transactions. By setting the
    <code>delay</code> parameter (for example, 15 seconds), you give Revision 1 15 seconds to
    finish processing existing transactions.</li>

    <li>After the delay interval, Revision 1 is undeployed.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> With override set to <code>true</code>, Apigee will not undeploy
  Revision 1 if the basepath of Revision 1 differs from that of Revision 2. In such a scenario, you
  will end up having two revisions deployed in the same environment. This can break other plugins
  and wrappers that make use of the seamless deployment API if you are not accommodating for this
  scenario in your assertion.</aside>

          errors&#8212;set this parameter to the number of seconds you want undeployment to be
          delayed. There is no limit to the number of seconds you can set, and there are no
          performance ramifications for setting a large number of seconds. During the delay, no new
          traffic is sent to the old revision.</p>

          <p>Default is 0 (zero) seconds. When <code>override</code> is set to true and
          <code>delay</code> is 0, the existing revision is undeployed immediately after the new
          revision is deployed. Negative values are treated as 0 (zero) seconds.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>When <code>override=true</code> is used along with a <code>delay</code>, HTTP 5xx
  responses during deployment can be eliminated. This is because both API proxy revisions will be
  deployed simultaneously, with the older revision undeployed after the delay.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using the sample API proxies</a>,
  available on GitHub provide shell scripts that wrap the Apigee deploy tool. If for some reason
  you cannot use the Python deploy tool, then you can call the API directly. Both approaches are
  demonstrated in the sample scripts below.</p>

  <h3 id="scriptingagainsttheapi-wrappingthedeploytool">Wrapping the Deploy Tool</h3>

  <p>First, make sure the <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/tools">Python deploy tool</a> is
  available in your local environment.</p>

  <p>Then create a file to hold your credentials. The deployment scripts that you write will import
  these settings, helping you to centrally manage the credentials for your account. In the API
  Platform sample, this file is called <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/setup"><code>setenv.sh</code></a>.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash

org="Your ORG on enterprise.apigee.com"
username="Your USERNAME on enterprise.apigee.com"

# While testing, it's not necessary to change the setting below
env="test"
# Change the value below only if you have an on-premise deployment

# Change the value below only if you have a custom domain
api_domain="apigee.net"

export org=$org
export username=$username
export env=$env
export url=$url
export api_domain=$api_domain
</pre>

  <p>The file above makes all of your settings available to the shell scripts that wrap the deploy
  tool.</p>

  <p>Now create a shell script that imports those settings and uses them to call the deploy tool.
  (You can see an example <a href=
  "https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/setup">here</a>.)</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">

  <p>In some situations, it is not practical to collect the password when the script runs. For
  example, you may need to run a cron job that fires when no administrators are present. In these
  situations, you need to make the password available to the script without any human
  intervention.</p>

  <p>Follow these guidelines:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Centralize credentials in a single file that is used as a source for the programs and
    scripts that you write</li>

    <li>Protect the credentials source file to the extent possible using file system security and
    permissions</li>

    <li>Create an automation client with highly restricted permissions on specific resources in
    your organization.</li>
  </ol>{% endblock %}
