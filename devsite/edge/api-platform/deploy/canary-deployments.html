<p>Edge supports canary deployments for your API proxy releases. A <em>canary deployment</em> is a
full deployment of 2 different revisions of an API proxy, in which a random selection of requests go
to one revision, and the remaining users go to the other revision.</p>

<p>With canary deployments, you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Test new features with a limited audience:</strong> Try out new ideas with live
    traffic, without impacting all users.</li>
  <li><strong>Roll back to previous revision:</strong> If you discover an issue in a new revision,
    you can quickly roll it back so that all traffic returns to the current (or, <em>primary</em>)
    revision.</li>
  <li><strong>Compare performance:</strong> To help you decide when a revision is ready for all
    users, you can compare error rates and average response times for the new and primary revisions
    in the Edge UI.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In a canary deployment, there are two complete but different revisions of your API proxy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">BLUE</span></strong>) <em>Primary revision:</em> The
    current revision; this was deployed prior to the creation of the canary deployment.</li>
  <li>(<strong><span style="color:#38761d;">GREEN</span></strong>) <em>Canary revision:</em> The new
    revision that you want to test before rolling out to all users.</li>
</ul>

<p>You configure the percentage of requests that go to each revision, from 1 to 99%, in 1%
increments. For example, you might have 90% of requests go to your current (or <em>primary</em>)
revision, and just 10% to the new (or <em>canary</em>) revision that contains new features you want
to test. This is known as your proxy's <em>traffic percentage</em> or <em>traffic mix</em>.</p>

<h4>Multiple ways to create and manage</h4>

<p>You can create a new canary deployment, change its configuration, and end a canary deployment
using either the <a href="#management-api">Management API</a> or the <a href="#ui">Edge UI</a>.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes common actions you can take when working with canary
deployments:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>To create a new canary deployment, both the new and current (or <em>primary</em>) revisions must
share the same:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Base path
  <li>API proxy
  <li>Organization</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you must deploy both revisions to the same environment.</p>

<h4>API proxy requests</h4>

<p>To your API proxy users, the endpoint that they use when accessing your API proxy is the same,
regardless of whether you are testing a canary deployment. Proxy users cannot manually override a
request and send it to a specific revision in the deployment: all requests are treated the same and
are randomly sent to either the primary or canary revision in the deployment.</p>

<h4>User impact/performance</h4>

<p>Canary deployments have no impact on end-users: the deployment is completely transparent to
them and the developers who use your API proxies.</p>

<p>In addition, there is no impact on performance for canary deployments. Both proxy versions are
loaded into memory and requests are routed to one or the other based on a random, stateless,
per-request decision.</p>

<h4>Traffic mix limits</h4>

<p>The following table shows the minimum and maximum values that you can set for the traffic
mix:</p>

<table class="red">
  <tr>
   <th>Revision</th>
   <th>Minimum Traffic %</th>
   <th>Maximum Traffic %</th>
   <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Current/primary&nbsp;revision</td>
   <td>1%</td>
   <td>99%</td>
   <td rowspan="2" >You cannot disable or end either the canary revision or the primary revision in
     a canary deployment by changing the traffic mix to 0% or 100%. Instead, you must
     <a href="#mapi-promote">promote the canary revision</a> or
     <a href="#mapi-rollback">roll it back</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>New/canary&nbsp;revision</td>
   <td>1%</td>
   <td>99%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Conventions</h4>
<p>The examples in this section use the following conventions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Revision <strong>#1</strong> is the primary or currently deployed revision</li>
  <li>Revision <strong>#2</strong> is the new or canary revision that is being partially rolled
    out</li>
  <li>"ahamilton-eval" is the organization name</li>
  <li>"getstarted" is the API proxy name</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mapi">Use the management API with canary deployments</h2>

<p>You can use the management API to create, change, get status, and end canary
deployments.</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><var>org_name</var> is the name of the API proxy's organization. For example,
    "ahamilton-eval". Both revisions must be in the same organization.</li>
  <li><var>env_name</var> is the name of the API proxy's environment; this value is
    either "test" or "prod". Both revisions must be in the same environment.</li>
  <li><var>proxy_name</var> is the name of the API proxy on which you are deploying. For
    example, "getstarted". Both revisions must be in the same API proxy.</li>
  <li><var>revision_number</var> is the number assigned to each revision in the Edge UI.
    For example, "1" or "2". Higher numbers indicate later revisions.</li>
  <li><var>traffic_percentage</var> is the percentage of traffic that you want to send to
    the new revision in the canary deployment.</li>
  <li><code>override</code> determines if your request should ignore conflicts between revisions.
    You must set this to "true" when promoting a canary revision to be the new primary
    revisiion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the following about the management API requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All <code>POST</code> requests must set the <code>Content-Type</code> header to
    "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</li>
  <li>You can toggle the response format by setting the <code>Accept</code> header to
    "application/xml" or "application/json".</li>
</ul>

<aside class="key-point"><strong>TIP</strong><br/>The "o", "e", and "r" in management API
  calls is shorthand for "organizations", "environments", and "revisions", respectively.</aside>

<p>For a complete list of endpoints for the management API, see {{apiref}}.</p>

<h3 id="mapi-listall">List all revisions</h3>

<p>When working with canary deployments, you might find it useful to get a list of all revisions in
an API proxy. To do this, send a <code>GET</code> request to the following endpoint:</p>

<pre>{{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/<var>org_name</var>/apis/<var>proxy_name</var></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u ahamilton@apigee.com
  {{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/ahamilton-eval/apis/getstarted</pre>

<p>The management API's response contains an array that lists the revisions in the proxy:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{
  "metaData" : {
    ...
  },
  "name" : "getstarted",
  "revision" : [ "1", "2" ]
}
</pre>

<h3 id="mapi-details">Get canary deployment details</h3>

<p>To get details about the deployed revisions, including revisions that are part of canary
deployments, submit a <code>GET</code> request to the following endpoint:</p>

<pre>{{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/<var>org_name</var>/apis/<var>proxy_name</var>/deployments</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -u ahamilton@apigee.com {{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/ahamilton-eval \
  /apis/getstarted/deployments</pre>

<p>Edge returns a response in JSON format by default.</p>

<p>The following example shows a sample response for a proxy with a canary deployment.</p>

      <p>To get the output as XML, set the <code>Accept</code> header to "application/xml" in your

  <ul>
    <li>"/e/<var>env_name</var>" limits the response to only the specified environment</li>
    <li>"/r/<var>revision_number</var>" limits the response to only the specified revision</li>

    in different environment.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If you try to get information about a revision that does not exist, the management API returns
an <code>ApplicationRevisionDoesNotExist</code> error.</p>

<h3 id="mapi-create">Create a new canary deployment</h3>

<p>Traditionally, when you deploy a new revision with the management API, you undeploy the previous
revision and deploy the new revision. However, when you create a <em>canary</em> deployment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You do <strong><em>not</em></strong> undeploy the previous revision.</li>
  <li>When you deploy the new revision, you specify the percentage of traffic that you want Edge to
    send to the new revision with the <code>trafficPct</code> query parameter.</li>
</ol>

<p>To create a canary deployment, submit a <code>POST</code> request to the following endpoint:</p>

<pre>{{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/<var>org_name</var>/e/<var>env_name</var>/apis/<var>proxy_name</var> \
  /r/<var>revision_number</var>/deployments?trafficPct=<var>traffic_percent</var></pre>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><var>revision_number</var> is the latest (canary) revision, not the current primary
    revision.</li>
  <li><var>traffic_percent</var> is an integer from 1 to 99. For example, to send one
    third of the traffic to your new revision, set <code>trafficPct</code> to 33.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the revision number and traffic percentage are required when you create a new canary
deployment. If you do not specify the traffic percentage, but do specify <code>override=true</code>,
Edge deploys the new revision at 100% and undeploys (deletes) the previous revision. For more
information, see <a href="#mapi-end">End a canary deployment</a>.</p>

<p>The following example deploys revision "2", and instructs Edge to send 20% of all requests to
it:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u ahamilton@apigee.com
  {{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/ahamilton-eval/e/prod/apis/getstarted \
  /r/2/deployments?trafficPct=20</pre>

<p>Note that your request to create a new canary deployment must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the HTTP verb to <code>POST</code></li>
  <li>Set the <code>Content-Type</code> header to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</li>
</ul>

<p>Edge deploys the canary revision, and does not undeploy the primary revision. Both revisions are
deployed <em>at the same time</em> with the same base path.</p>

<p>If your request to create a canary deployment was successful, Edge returns details about the
newly deployed revision, including the <code>configuration</code> object described previously. For
example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">{
  "name" : "getstarted",
  "organization" : "ahamilton-eval",
  "environment" : [ {
    "name" : "prod",
    "revision" : [
      {
        "configuration" : {
          "basePath" : "/",
          "canaryPrimaryRevision" : 1,
          "canary" : true,
          "trafficPercent" : 22
        },
        ... // pod details
        "name" : "2",
        "state" : "deployed"
      }
  } ]
}</pre>

<h3 id="mapi-mix">Change the traffic mix</h3>

<p>You can increase or decrease the percentage of traffic that Edge sends to a canary revision. To
do this with the management API, submit a <code>POST</code> request to the following endpoint:</p>

<pre>{{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/<var>org_name</var>/e/<var>env_name</var>/apis/<var>proxy_name</var> \
  /r/<var>revision_number</var>/deployments?trafficPct=<var>traffic_percent</var></pre>

<p>For example, if you set your canary revision's (2) initial traffic percentage to 20, but you want to
increase it to 50, send a request like the following:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u ahamilton@apigee.com
  {{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/ahamilton-eval/e/prod/apis/getstarted \
  /r/2/deployments?trafficPct=50</pre>

<p>You cannot fully deploy a new revision by setting <code>trafficPct</code> to 100. Instead,
<a href="#mapi-end">end the canary release</a> and deploy the new revision as a standard
revision.</p>

<h3 id="mapi-end">End a canary deployment with the management API</h3>

<p>You typically end a canary deployment because you want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="#mapi-promote">Promote the canary revision</a>:</strong> Replace the
    primary revision with the canary revision and begin sending all traffic to it.
    <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="#mapi-rollback">Roll back to the primary revision</a>:</strong> Undeploy
    the canary revision and send all requests back to the primary revision.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="mapi-promote">Promote the canary revision</h4>

<p><strong>To end a canary deployment and promote the canary revision:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Deploy your new primary revision (previously the canary revision) <em>without specifying
    <code>trafficPct</code></em>. Do this by sending a <code>POST</code> request to the following
    endpoint:
    <pre>{{mgmt_api_basepath}}/v1/o/<var>org_name</var>/e/<var>env_name</var>/apis/<var>proxy_name</var><strong> \
  /r/<var>revision_number</var></strong>/deployments?override=true</pre>
    <p>For example, if you complete the testing of a new revision (2) and want to deploy it so that it
    is used by 100% of the requests, you can send a request like the following:</p>
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded"
  {{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/ahamilton-eval/e/prod/apis/getstarted \
  /<strong>r/2</strong>/deployments?override=true</pre>
    <p>Note that you must set the <code>override</code> query parameter to <code>true</code> when
    you promote the canary revision via the management API.</p>
    <p>Edge deploys the new revision, and once the deployment is complete, the existing primary
    revision is undeployed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can only end a canary deployment by fully deploying the canary revision or rolling back to
the primary revision. You cannot deploy any other revision until a canary deployment is ended.</p>

<h4 id="mapi-rollback">Roll back to the primary revision</h4>

<p>If, in this example, you decided that revision 2 was not yet ready for release, you can roll back
to the primary revision (1) by undeploying the canary revision (2).</p>

<p><strong>To end a canary deployment and roll back to the primary revision:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Send a <code>DELETE</code> request to the following endpoint:
    <pre >{{mgmt_api_basepath}}/v1/o/<var>org_name</var>/e/<var>env_name</var>/apis/<var>proxy_name</var> \
  /r/<var>revision_number</var>/deployments</pre>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre class="devsite-terminal">curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded"
  {{mgmt_api_basepath}}/o/ahamilton-eval/e/prod/apis/getstarted \
  /<strong>r/2</strong>/deployments</pre>
    <p>Edge removes the canary revision, ending the canary deployment. Edge now sends 100% of the
    traffic to the primary revision.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You cannot send a <code>DELETE</code> request that removes the <em>primary</em> revision during a
canary deployment.</p>

<h2 id="ui">Use the Edge UI with canary deployments</h2>

<p>This section describes how to work with canary deployments in the Edge UI.</p>

<h3 id="ui-view">View canary deployment status</h3>

<p>The UI uses blue and green to indicate the {{primary_revision}} and
{{canary_revision}} revisions, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>To view your API proxy's deployment status:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the {{mgmt_ui}} in a browser and log in.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>API Proxies</strong> in the main window.
    <p>The Management UI displays a list of proxies for the current environment in the
    <strong>Proxies</strong> view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the name of the API proxy whose canary deployment status you want to view.
    <p>The Management UI displays a list of environments in which that proxy is running in the
    Deployments Overview:</p>
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/overview-status.png" class="screenshot"></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Revision</strong> column indicates which revision is deployed in each environment.
For canary deployments, the <strong>Revision</strong> column shows two revision numbers
(the {{canary_revision}} revision and the {{primary_revision}} revision), and indicates the
percentage of traffic that goes to each revision.</p>

<p>The <strong>Status</strong> column tells you if a proxy is functional. It also provides a visual
indicator of whether a canary deployment exists for that environment, and if so, how the traffic is
split between the two revisions:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/status-icon-all.png"></p></td>
   <td>A single, non-canary deployment with 100% of the traffic going to a single, primary
     revision.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/status-icon-halfnhalf.png"></p></td>
   <td>A canary deployment with about 50% of traffic going to the primary revision, and 50% going to
     the canary revision.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/status-icon-mostcanary.png"></p></td>
   <td>A canary deployment with most of the traffic going to the current (or <em>primary</em>)
     revision.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/status-icon-disabled.png"></p></td>
   <td>An undeployed or otherwise non-functioning API proxy.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Note that if you hover over an icon in the <strong>Status</strong> column, the UI displays a
tooltip with the exact traffic split:</p>

<p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/status-icon-tooltip.png" class="screenshot"></p>

<p>Click the <strong>Status</strong> icon to edit the traffic mix for that deployment, as described
in <a href="#ui-mix">Change the traffic mix</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ui-create">Create a new canary deployment</h3>

<p><strong>To create a new canary deployment in the UI:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the {{mgmt_ui}} in a browser and log in.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>API Proxies</strong> in the main window.
    <p>The Management UI displays a list of proxies for the current environment in the
    <strong>Proxies</strong> view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click an API proxy to edit.</li>
  <li>In the row for the environment that you want to add a canary deployment, click the {{kebab}}
    icon. The Management UI displays a list of options:

    <p>[[tbd]]</p>

  <li>Select the <strong>Canary Deployment</strong> option.
    <p>The <strong>Create New Deployment</strong> dialog appears:</p>
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/create-new-deployment.png" class="screenshot"></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Create New Deployment</strong> dialog, select <strong>Canary Deployment</strong>
    for the <strong>Type</strong>.
    <p>The Create New Deployment dialog expands to include settings for a canary deployment:</p>
    <p><var>[screenshot TBD]</var></p>
  </li>
  <li>Set the traffic mix, with the following considerations:
  <ul>
    <li>It's generally a good idea to start with a small percentage of traffic (such as 5 or 10%)
      for the canary revision and gradually increase it.</li>
    <li>Be sure to set the mix high enough that you'll get meaningful data based on your traffic
      levels.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Select the environment in which to create the canary deployment.</li>
  <li>Select the revision that will be the canary revision (the partially rolled out one). This is
    typically the most recent revision in the API proxy.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Deploy</strong> button.
    <p>Edge deploys your new revision and the current revision with a new proxy configuration. Edge
    immediately begins to route the specified percentage of incoming requests to the canary
    revision, and the remaining requests to the primary revision.</p>
    <p>Within a few minutes, you should see analytics data comparing the two revisions, as described
    in <a href="#perf">View revision performance</a>. Even though analytics data is delayed by a
    few minutes, the change to your incoming requests happens immediately (whether you changed the
    mix with <a href="#mapi-mix">the management API</a> or with
    <a href="#ui-change">the UI</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ui-change">Change the traffic mix</h3>

<p>You can change the traffic mix for an existing canary deployment in the Edge Management UI. You
can do this without stopping or undeploying either of the revisions in the canary deployment.</p>

<p><strong>To change the traffic mix in the UI:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the {{mgmt_ui}} in a browser and log in.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>API Proxies</strong> in the main window.
    <p>Edge displays the <strong>API Proxies Overview</strong>, which shows you a list of
    environments and deployment information for each.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the {{kebab}} next to the environment that you want to change.
    <p>Edge displays the following drop-down menu:</p>
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/3dot-menu.png" class="screenshot"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Select <strong>Change Canary Deployment</strong> from the list.
    <aside class="key-point"><strong>TIP</strong><br/>Alternatively, you can click the
    traffic split icon in the <strong>Status</strong> column.</aside>
    <p>Edge displays the <strong>Change Deployment</strong> dialog:</p>
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/change-deployment-2.png" class="screenshot"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use the slider and/or input fields to adjust the traffic mix.
    <p>You cannot set either revision's traffic to 0% or 100% to end a canary deployment. To end
    a canary deployment, you must follow the instructions in
    <a href="#ui-end">End a canary deployment in the UI</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Deploy</strong> button.
    <p>Edge immediately adjusts the percentage of requests that are sent to each of the revisions
    in the canary deployment.</p>
    <p>Note that although the change in the traffic mix applies to all new requests immediately, the
    <a href="#perf">performance statistics</a> are delays by a few minutes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ui-end">End a canary deployment in the UI</h3>

<p>You typically end a canary deployment because you want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="#promote-ui">Promote the canary revision</a>:</strong> Replace the
    primary revision with the canary revision and begin sending all traffic to it.
    <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="#rollback-ui">Roll back to the primary revision</a>:</strong> Undeploy
    the canary revision and send all requests back to the primary revision.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="promote-ui">Promote the canary revision in the UI</h4>
<p><strong>To end a canary deployment and promote the canary revision:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the {{mgmt_ui}} in a browser and log in.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>API Proxies</strong> in the main window. Edge displays the <strong>API Proxies
    Overview,</strong> which shows you a list of environments and deployment information for
    each.</li>
  <li>Click the 3-dot menu next to the environment you want to change.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Promote Revision <var>X</var></strong> from the list, where <var>X</var> is the
    revision number of your canary revision.
    <p>Edge displays the <strong>Confirm Promotion</strong> dialog:<p>
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/confirm-promotion.png" class="screenshot" width="50%"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Promote</strong> button.
    <p>Edge undeploys the primary revision and immediately begins sending <em>all</em> requests to
    the canary revision, which has now become the primary revision. Edge also changes the deployment
    configuration to a standard deployment. It is no longer considered a canary deployment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="rollback-ui">Roll back to the primary revision in the UI</h4>

<p><strong>To end a canary deployment and roll back to the primary revision:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the {{mgmt_ui}} in a browser and log in.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>API Proxies</strong> in the main window. Edge displays the <strong>API Proxies
    Overview,</strong> which shows you a list of environments and deployment information for
    each.</li>
  <li>Click the 3-dot menu next to the environment you want to change.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Roll Back to Revision <var>Y</var></strong> from the list, where <var>Y</var>
    is the revision number of your primary revision.
    <p>Edge displays the <strong>Confirm Rollback</strong> dialog:</p>
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/confirm-rollback.png" class="screenshot" width="50%"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Roll Back</strong> button.
    <p>Edge undeploys the canary revision and immediately returns to sending <em>all</em> requests
    to the primary revision. Edge also changes the deployment configuration to a standard
    deployment. It is no longer considered a canary deployment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="perf">View revision performance</h2>

<p>The Edge UI visualizes performance statistics (or <em>analytics</em>) for each revision in the
<strong>Canary Dashboard</strong>.</p>

<p>By looking at these statistics, you can decide if you should continue to roll out a canary
revision, or roll back to the primary revision.</p>

<p>Analytics data can take several minutes to reflect a new canary deployment or a change to an
existing one. Because of this delay in analytics, you should avoid making rapid changes to the
traffic mix.</p>

<p>Note that even though analytics data is delayed by a few minutes, the change to your incoming
requests happens immediately.</p>

<p><strong>To view performance statistics:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the {{mgmt_ui}} in a browser and log in.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>API Proxies</strong> in the main window.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Canary</strong> tab:
    <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/canary-tab.png" class="screenshot"></p>
    <!-- <p><var>Is this tab only visible if at least one environment has a canary deployment?</var></p> -->
    <p>Edge displays the <strong>Canary Dashboard</strong>:</p>
      <p><img src="/api-platform/images/canary/canary-dashboard.png" class="screenshot"></p>
    <p>The <strong>Errors</strong> graph shows the percentage of requests that resulted in an error
    for the revision.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Average Response Time</strong> graph shows the average time, in milliseconds, that
    the API proxy takes to respond to a request.</p>
  <li>To change the environment, select a new one from the <strong>Environment</strong>
    drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the graphs, note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The {{primary_revision}} revision is <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">BLUE</span></strong>.</li>
  <li>The {{canary_revision}} revision is <strong><span style="color:#38761d;">GREEN</span></strong>.</li>
  <li>You can view performance data for the following time periods:
    <ul>
      <li>Hour</li>
      <li>Day</li>
      <li>Week (default)</li>
      <li>Custom: Select a date range of up to 6 months in the past ({{edge_long}}) or 15 days
      ({{opdk}}). These limits
      <a href="/api-platform/analytics/using-analytics-dashboards.html#whatarethemostcommonfeaturesinthedashboards">can be modified</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you change the timeframe, click the refresh button
    <img src="/api-platform/images/canary/refresh.png"/> to refresh the graph data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the Errors graph</h3>

<p>The Errors graph shows the percentage of requests that resulted in an error for the revision.
This value represents all errors, whether they were caught and handled within Edge or not.</p>

<p>Use the radio buttons at the right of the graph to filter by error type:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>All Errors</strong>: Include errors that occur anywhere in the proxy flow.</li>
  <li><strong>Proxy Errors</strong>: Only include errors that are thrown when the request or
    response is being handled in the ProxyEndpoint.</li>
  <li><strong>Target Errors</strong>: Only include errors that are thrown when the request or
    response is being handled in the TargetEndpoint.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default Errors graph filter is <strong>All Errors</strong>.</p>

<h3>About the Average Response Time graph</h3>

<p>The Average Response Time shows you the average time, in milliseconds, that it takes the API
proxy to respond to a request.</p>

<p>Use the radio buttons at the right of the graph to filter by endpoint:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Both endpoints:</strong> Represents the "total" average response time, which is the time
  measured from when an API call is received on Apigee Edge to the time Edge begins sending a
  response back to the client app.</li>
<li><strong>ProxyEndpoint only:</strong> The time the request spends being processed by Edge; does
  not include time spent being processed by the TargetEndpoint.</li>
<li><strong>TargetEndpoint only:</strong> The time the request spends being processed by the
  TargetEndpoint; to put it another way, it's the time the request is not being processed by Edge,
  but rather, being processed by the backend system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default Average Response Time graph filter is <strong>Both Endpoints</strong>.</p>
