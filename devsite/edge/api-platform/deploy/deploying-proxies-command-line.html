  <p>This topic explains how to deploy a proxy from the command line. Apigee Edge provides two
  options for deploying from the command line. The first is to use an Apigee Edge deploy tool
  written in Python. The other is to configure and run a shell script.</p>

  <p>Use the command line deployment techniques when you are working directly with proxy source
  files on your system. There are many reasons why you may be working offline. You may wish to use
  a favorite XML editor or you may be developing policies that require Java coding and you are
  working primarily in an IDE. The techniques described in this section allow you to upload and
  deploy your source files to the API Services environment that you choose.</p>

  <p>If you are working primarily in the management UI, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/deploy/deploying-proxies-ui.html">Deploying proxies in the UI</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="runningtheapigeeedgepythondeploytool">Running the Apigee Edge Python deploy tool</h2>

  <p>The Apigee Edge Python deploy tool works with the Edge management API to import and deploy API
  proxies. The tool is available as part of the API Platform Samples distribution on GitHub. See
  <a href="/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using the sample API proxies</a>.</p>

  <p>Use the Apigee Edge Python tool to import (upload) and deploy your API in one simple
  process.</p>

  <p>The deploy tool must be run from the base directory in the distribution of the API Platform
  Samples distribution, where the base directory is the parent directory of the <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">setup</span> and <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">tools</span> directory.</p>

  <p>In the following command, substitute the proxy name, your Edge username and password, the Edge
  organization and environment, and the path to the directory that contains the API proxy's
  "<code>apiproxy"</code> directory:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$python tools/deploy.py -n <em><strong>proxyname</strong></em> -u <strong><em>name</em></strong>:<strong><em>passW</em></strong> -o <strong><em>org</em></strong> -e <strong><em>env</em></strong> -d <strong><em>proxypath</em></strong> <span style="font-family: monospace;">-p /</span>
</pre>

  <p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For example:</span></p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ python tools/deploy.py -n <strong>weatherapi</strong> -u <strong>me@myCo.com</strong>:<strong>foo</strong> -o <strong>myCo</strong> -e test -d <strong>weatherapi</strong> <span style="font-family: monospace;">-p /</span>
</pre>

  <p>This command zips your files, pushes them to your organization on Apigee Edge, and deploys
  them to the specified environment.</p>

  <p>The deploy tool automatically discovers the current revision of your API
  proxy, undeploys the existing revision, and deploys an incremented revision of the API
  proxy.</p>

  <p>On success you see output in the form:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
Writing ./&lt;proxybasedir&gt;/apiproxy/weatherapi.xml to apiproxy/weatherapi.xml
Writing ./&lt;proxybasedir&gt;/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml to apiproxy/proxies/default.xml
Writing ./&lt;proxybasedir&gt;/apiproxy/targets/default.xml to apiproxy/targets/default.xml
Imported new proxy version 1
Environment: test
  Revision: 1 BasePath = /
  State: deployed
</pre>

  <p>By default, the tool uploads the API proxy to <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com</span>,
  corresponding to Edge in the cloud. You can also use this tool to upload the API proxy to an
  on-premises version of Edge by specifying the <span style=
  "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">-h</span> flag:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
$ python tools/deploy.py -n weatherapi -u me@myCo.com:foo -o myCo -e test -d weatherapi -p / <strong>-h https://192.168.11.111:8080</strong>
</pre>

  <p>In this example, you specify the IP address of the Edge management server. If you have created
  a DNS record for the management server, you can specify a URL in the form <span style=
  "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://ms_URL:8080.</span></p>

  <p>The complete list of flags for the command are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>-n</code>: The name of your API proxy.</li>

    <li><code>-u</code>: The username and password for your account in an organization in Apigee
    Edge.</li>

    <li><code>-o</code>: The name of the organization in which you have an account.</li>

    <li><code>-e</code>: The environment to which the API proxy should be deployed
    (<code>test</code> or <code>prod</code>).</li>

    <li><code>-d</code>: The path to the directory containing your API proxy files. Your API proxy
    files must be stored under a directory named "<span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">apiproxy</span>". This value is the path of the
    directory that contains the "<span style=
    "font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">apiproxy</span>" directory, and not to the path to
    the "<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">apiproxy</span>" directory
    itself.</li>

    <li><code>-p</code>: The URI path used as a pattern match to route incoming message to this API
    proxy deployment. In most cases, you can set this value to '/', unless you have advanced
    deployment and routing requirements. The primary path used for API proxy routing is defined in
    the API proxy's ProxyEndpoint configuration file.</li>

    <li><code>-h</code>: The Edge URL. By default, the URL is <span style=
    "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://api.enterprise.apigee.com</span>,
    corresponding to Edge in the cloud. For an on-premises deployment, use the URL of the Edge
    management server and port 8080, as in: <span style=
    "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://ms_URL:8080</span>. Or, use the IP
    address of the management server, as in <span style=
    "font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">https://192.168.11.111:8080</span>. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="configuringandrunningadeployshellscript">Configuring and running a deploy shell
  script</h2>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The shell script described in this section is included with the
  API Platform Samples distribution. For information on downloading the samples distribution, see
  <a href="/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using the sample API proxies</a>. This section
  assumes that you have obtained the shell script.</aside>

  <p>The easiest approach is to run the deploy script provided with the sample API proxy. The shell
  scripts wrap the Apigee Edge Python deploy tool.</p>

  <p>From the <code>/simplyProxy</code> directory run:</p><code>$ sh deploy.sh</code>

  <p>You should see:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
Enter your password for user {myname} in the Apigee Enterprise organization {org_name}, followed by [ENTER]: 
</pre>

  <p>Enter your password, press ENTER.</p>

  <p>You should then see:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
Deploying to test on https://api.enterprise.apigee.com using {myname} on enterprise.apigee.com and {org_name} on enterprise.apigee.com
</pre>

  <p>If you see the following:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
Enter your password for user Your USERNAME on enterprise.apigee.com in the Apigee Enterprise organization Your ORG on enterprise.apigee.com, followed by [ENTER]: 
</pre>

  <p>it means that you need to modify the <code>/setup/setenv.sh</code> file in the
  platform samples distribution. For instructions, refer to the README or to <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/apis/api-reference-getting-started.html">API reference getting
  started</a>.</p>

  <p>On success, the deploy tool ZIPs up the files under <code>/apiproxy,</code> imports
  the package to your organization on Apigee Edge, and then deploys the API proxy to the 'test'
  environment.</p>

  <p>Your API proxy is ready to be invoked.</p>{% endblock %}
