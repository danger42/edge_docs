          <p>For that, use the Spike Arrest policy or Concurrent Rate Limit policy.</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Don't use it to count and limit the number of connections apps can make to your API
          proxy's target backend over a specific period of time.</p>

          <p>For that, use the Quota policy.</p>

        <td>
          <p>Attach it to the <strong>ProxyEndpoint Request PreFlow</strong>, generally after the
          authentication of the user.</p>

          <p>This enables the policy to check the quota counter at the entry point of your API
          proxy.</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Attach it to the <strong>ProxyEndpoint Request PreFlow</strong>, generally at the very
          beginning of the flow.</p>

          <p>This provides spike protection at the entry point of your API proxy.</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>This policy must be attached in these three locations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>TargetEndpoint Request PreFlow</strong></li>

            <li><strong>TargetEndpoint Response PreFlow</strong></li>

        <td>Good to know:</td>

        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Quota counter is stored in Cassandra.</li>

            <li>Configure the policy to synchronize the counter asynchronously to save
            resources.</li>

            <li>Asynchronous counter synchronization may cause a delay in the rate limiting
            response, which may allow calls slightly in excess of the limit you've set.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>

        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Performs throttling based on the time at which the last traffic was received. This
            time is stored per message processor.</li>

            <li>If you specify a rate limit of 100 calls per second, only 1 call every 1/100 second
            (10 ms) will be allowed on the message processor. A second call within 10 ms will be
            rejected.</li>

            <li>Even with a high rate limit per second, nearly simultaneous requests may result in
            rejections.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>

        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Keeps a count of concurrent connections per message processor.</li>

            <li>While an individual API proxy may be handling just a few connections, collectively,
            the connections to a set of replicated API proxies pointing to the same backend service
            may swamp the capacity of the service. Use this policy to limit this traffic to a
            manageable number of connections.</li>
            <li>{# b/67179002 #}This policy is known to slow performance in API proxies that handle
            a high number of transactions per second (TPS). For high-TPS API proxies, if
            Concurrent Rate Limit slows performance to unacceptable levels, try using
            Spike Arrest instead.</li>

  <p><span style="color:#ff0000;">* The default HTTP status code for exceeding the rate limit is
  500. If you want the status code to be 429 for all three policy types used in an organization
  (Quota, Spike Arrest, and Concurrent Rate Limit), a property needs to be set on your organization
  (<code>features.isHTTPStatusTooManyRequestEnabled</code>). If you're a Cloud customer,
