  <p>CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript
  XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin
  domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "<a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a>" that is enforced by
  all browsers. For example, if you make an XHR call to the Twitter API from JavaScript code
  executing in your browser, the call will fail. This is because the domain serving the page to
  your browser is not the same as the domain serving the Twitter API. CORS provides a solution to
  this problem by allowing servers to "opt-in" if they wish to provide cross-origin resource
  sharing. </p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> Most modern browsers support CORS. You can find a comprehensive list of supported
    browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/cors">here</a>. For an in-depth description of
    CORS, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing W3C
    Recommendation</a>.

    <p>If you are using a <a href="/api-platform/cache/persistence-tools.html">cache
    policy</a> on your API proxy, you must ensure that the response of the CORS policy is not
    cached.</p>

  <h2 id="typicalusecaseforcors">Typical use case for CORS</h2>

  <p>The following JQuery code calls a fictitious target service. If executed from within the
  context of a browser (a web page), the call will fail because of the same-origin policy:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;script&gt;
var url = "http://service.example.com";
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $.ajax({
        type:"GET",
        url:url,
        async:true,
        dataType: "json",
           success: function(json) {
              // Parse the response.
              // Do other things.
           },
           error: function(xhr, status, err) {
              // This is where we end up! 
            }
    });
  });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

  <p>One solution to this problem is to create an Apigee API proxy that calls the service API on
  the back end. Remember that Edge sits between the client (a browser in this case) and the backend
  API (the service). Because the API proxy executes on the server, not in a browser, it
  <strong><em>is</em></strong> able to call the service successfully. Then, all you need to do
  is attach CORS headers to the TargetEndpoint response. As long as the browser supports CORS,
  these headers signal to the browser that it's okay to "relax" its same-origin policy, allowing
  the cross-origin API call to succeed.</p>

  <p>Once the proxy with CORS support is created, you can call the API proxy URL instead of the
  backend service in your client-side code. For example:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;script&gt;
var url = "http://myorg-test.apigee.net/v1/example";
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $.ajax({
        type:"GET",
        url:url,
        async:true,
        dataType: "json",
           success: function(json) {
              // Parse the response.
              // Do other things.
           },
           error: function(xhr, status, err) {
              // This time, we do not end up here!
            }
    });
  });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In the simplest case, you can return CORS headers to the client
  and the cross-origin request will work. More complicated cases exist where a "preflight" request
  is required. You can read about preflight CORS requests in <a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing W3C Recommendation</a>, as well as in
  numerous articles and blogs. See also "<a href="#Preflight">Handling CORS preflight requests</a>"
  below.</aside>

  <h2 id="attachinganaddcorspolicytoanewapiproxy">Attaching an Add CORS policy to a new API
  proxy </h2>

  <p>You can add CORS support to an API proxy by attaching an "Add CORS" policy to the API proxy
  when you create it. To add this policy, select the <strong>Add CORS headers</strong> checkbox in
  the Security page of the Build a Proxy wizard. </p>

  <p>When you select this checkbox, a policy called Add CORS is automatically added to the system
  and attached to the TargetEndpoint response preflow, as shown in the following figure:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/cors-policy-attach_1.png"></p>

  <p>The Add CORS policy is implemented as an <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/assign-message-policy.html">AssignMessage policy</a>, which
  adds the appropropriate headers to the response. Here is the XML for the Add CORS policy:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;AssignMessage async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="add-cors"&gt;
    &lt;DisplayName&gt;Add CORS&lt;/DisplayName&gt;
    &lt;FaultRules/&gt;
    &lt;Properties/&gt;
    &lt;Add&gt;
        &lt;Headers&gt;
            &lt;Header name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin"&gt;{request.header.origin}&lt;/Header&gt;
            &lt;Header name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers"&gt;origin, x-requested-with, accept, content-type&lt;/Header&gt;
            &lt;Header name="Access-Control-Max-Age"&gt;3628800&lt;/Header&gt;
            &lt;Header name="Access-Control-Allow-Methods"&gt;GET, PUT, POST, DELETE&lt;/Header&gt;
        &lt;/Headers&gt;
    &lt;/Add&gt;
    &lt;IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&gt;true&lt;/IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&gt;
    &lt;AssignTo createNew="false" transport="http" type="response"/&gt;
&lt;/AssignMessage&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Basically, the headers let the browser know which origins it will share its resources with,
  which methods it accepts, and so on. You can read more about these CORS headers in the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing W3C Recommendation</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="addingcorsheaderstoanexistingproxy">Adding CORS headers to an existing proxy</h2>

  <p>You need to manually create a new Assign Message policy and copy the code for the Add CORS
  policy listed in the previous section into it. Then, attach the policy to the response preflow of
  the TargetEndpoint of the API proxy. You can modify the header values as needed. For more
  information on creating and attaching policies, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/develop/policy-attachment-and-enforcement.html">What's a policy?</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="handlingcorspreflightrequests"><a id="Preflight" name="Preflight"></a>Handling CORS
  preflight requests</h2>

  <p><strong>CORS preflight</strong> refers to sending a request to a server to verify if it
  supports CORS. Typical preflight responses include which origins the server will accept CORS
  requests from, a list of HTTP methods that are supported for CORS requests, headers that can be
  used as part of the resource request, the maximum time preflight response will be cached, and
  others. If the service does not indicate CORS support or does not wish to accept cross-origin
  requests from the client's origin, the cross-origin policy of the browser will be enforced and
  any cross-domain requests made from the client to interact with resources hosted on that server
  will fail.</p>

  <p>Typically, CORS preflight requests are made with the HTTP OPTIONS method. When a server that
  supports CORS receives an OPTIONS request, it returns a set of CORS headers to the client that
  indicate its level of CORS support. As a result of this handshake, the client knows what it is
  allowed to request from the non-origin domain. </p>

  <p>For more information on preflight, refer to the <a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing W3C Recommendation</a>. There are in
  addition numerous blogs and articles on CORS that you can refer to.</p>

  <p>Apigee does not include a CORS preflight solution out of the box, but it is possible to
  implement, as described in this section. The objective is for the proxy to evaluate an OPTIONS
  request in a conditional flow. The proxy can then send an appropriate response back to the
  client. </p>

  <p>Let's look at a sample flow, and then discuss the parts that handle the preflight request:<br>
   </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;ProxyEndpoint name="default"&gt;
    &lt;Description/&gt;
    &lt;Flows&gt;
        <strong>&lt;Flow name="OptionsPreFlight"&gt;
            &lt;Request/&gt;
            &lt;Response&gt;
                &lt;Step&gt;
                    &lt;Name&gt;add-cors&lt;/Name&gt;
                &lt;/Step&gt;
            &lt;/Response&gt;
        &lt;Condition&gt;request.verb == "OPTIONS" AND request.header.origin != null AND request.header.Access-Control-Request-Method != null&lt;/Condition&gt; 
        &lt;/Flow&gt;</strong>
    &lt;/Flows&gt;

    &lt;PreFlow name="PreFlow"&gt;
        &lt;Request/&gt;
        &lt;Response/&gt;

    &lt;/PreFlow&gt;
    &lt;HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
        &lt;BasePath&gt;/v1/cnc&lt;/BasePath&gt;
        &lt;VirtualHost&gt;default&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
        &lt;VirtualHost&gt;secure&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
    &lt;/HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
    <strong>&lt;RouteRule name="NoRoute"&gt;
        &lt;Condition&gt;request.verb == "OPTIONS" AND request.header.origin != null AND request.header.Access-Control-Request-Method != null&lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;/RouteRule&gt;</strong>
    &lt;RouteRule name="default"&gt;
        &lt;TargetEndpoint&gt;default&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
   &lt;/RouteRule&gt;
   &lt;PostFlow name="PostFlow"&gt;
        &lt;Request/&gt;
        &lt;Response/&gt;
    &lt;/PostFlow&gt;
&lt;/ProxyEndpoint&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The key parts of this ProxyEndpoint are as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A RouteRule is created to a NULL target with a condition for the OPTIONS request. Note that
    there is no TargetEndpoint specified. If the OPTIONS request is received and the Origin and
    Access-Control-Request-Method request headers are not null, the proxy immediately returns the
    CORS headers in a response to the client (bypassing the actual default "backend" target).
     For details on flow conditions and RouteRule, see <a href=
    "/api-platform/fundamentals/flow-variables-and-conditions.html">Flow variables and
    conditions</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;RouteRule name="NoRoute"&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;request.verb == "OPTIONS" AND request.header.origin != null AND request.header.Access-Control-Request-Method != null&lt;/Condition&gt;
&lt;/RouteRule&gt;
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>An OptionsPreFlight flow is created that adds an Add CORS policy, containing the CORS
    headers, to the flow if an OPTIONS request is received and the Origin and
    Access-Control-Request-Method request headers are not null. <br>
      <br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
 &lt;Flow name="OptionsPreFlight"&gt;
            &lt;Request/&gt;
            &lt;Response&gt;
                &lt;Step&gt;
                    &lt;Name&gt;add-cors&lt;/Name&gt;
                &lt;/Step&gt;
            &lt;/Response&gt;
        &lt;Condition&gt;request.verb == "OPTIONS" AND request.header.origin != null AND request.header.Access-Control-Request-Method != null&lt;/Condition&gt; 
 &lt;/Flow&gt;
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul><br>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> RouteRules are evaluated in the order specified in the
  ProxyEndpoint configuration. You should always have the default (no condition) Route at the end.
  Otherwise, if at the top, it will always match and never evaluate the other Route
