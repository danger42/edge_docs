  <p>Apigee is a multitenant, self-service, cloud-based platform that runs in a fully redundant
  (live/live) configuration across multiple datacenters in multiple regions of the globe. Apigee
  uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our cloud-based platform. As
  part of the services we build on GCP and AWS, we use multiple data centers within each region and
  service live traffic for our customers across these multiple data centers. We do not have a
  "live" data center and a "standby" (or "secondary" or "failover") data center. We have two (or
  more) data centers constantly and simultaneously servicing customer traffic in each region
  globally.</p>

  <h2 id="bcpdrplan">BCP/DR plan</h2>

  <p>Apigee Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR) is a platform-wide plan and
  does not contain detailed tasks for individual customers. Rather, the platform is configured to
  process customer data requests regardless of disruptions and outages. The data will continue to
  flow even if an entire data center is offline. If an entire region were to go offline, a
  single-region customer could experience an outage of API processing services. For customers
  looking for more than "in-region" redundant services, Apigee offers a globally redundant level of
  redundant data centers where traffic can be serviced in multiple regions or countries so that if
  an entire region goes offline, the data still flows.</p>

  <p>Single-region customer services are not automatically transferred to another region because of
  possible geographic restrictions on data processing and access. Apigee hosts services for
  customers in the region identified by the customer. Because there may be specific regulations or
  customer commitments to their users on geographic locations of data, Apigee will not
  automatically move services to an alternate region, as this could potentially compromise Apigee's
  commitments to its customers or Apigee customers' commitments to their customers.</p>

  <p>Apigee does not share the full BCP/DR plan with any individual customer, as it contains Apigee
  internal sensitive information and references to our customers. Our privacy policy prevents
  sharing the platform BCP/DR plan with individual customers that could potentially expose other
  customer names. We offer this same level of privacy to each customer.</p>

  <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

  <p>Apigee performs operational processes that support BCP/DR testing of the platform on a more
  frequent cadence than our full annual BCP/DR tabletop testing. Each month Apigee performs load
  swings from our live/live environment while we perform updates to the systems running the
  service. This process involves taking down one entire data center's worth of systems while the
  load is handled by the peer datacenter. During this process, after any updates are performed, the
  first data center is brought back up and services are run live/live again to verify that no
  issues were introduced. Then the peer datacenter is brought down for the same updates and then
  brought back online again. Apigee uses tools and techniques to drain traffic and send a small
  percentage of traffic to recently updated services to check for any issues or errors before going
  back to full load processing.</p>

  <p>This consistent operational process exceeds industry-standard bi-annual resiliency "testing"
  of our service by making it an operational task that occurs more frequently.</p>

  <p>In addition to the operational processes described above, Apigee also conducts tabletop BCP/DR
  exercises at least once annually where engineering and operations team members are brought
  together with other Apigee business units to logically simulate and walk through issues,
  responses, and the impact of decisions made in a mock disaster scenario. This provides additional
  training and experience for our personnel on our larger BCP/DR plans for the enterprise as a
  whole in addition to the service itself.</p>

  <p>The BCP/DR testing done by Apigee does not use "failover exercises" or "secondary locations"
  because all of that is built into the running system.</p>

  <p>Aigee does not share BCP/DR test reports with individual customers, because these tests are
  done at a platform level, not a customer level. We share the results of our operational tasks and
  annual tabletop exercise test reports with our third-party auditors, and these form the basis for
  the auditor's review of our compliance with PCI, HIPAA, contractual, and other requirements.</p>

  <h3 id="testing-customerbcpdrtests">Customer BCP/DR tests</h3>

  <p>Customers are encouraged to have their own DR plans incorporate Apigee Edge services. Customer
  can and should consider how Apigee can redirect traffic as needed for customers to maintain
  end-user services even during a customer data center outage or other disaster event. However,
  this level of testing is outside the scope of the Apigee DR plan. We encourage customers to
  perform BCP/DR testing on their own applications and include Apigee Edge in the test.</p>

  <h3 id="testing-rtorpo">RTO/RPO</h3>

  <p>Apigee does not have recovery point and recovery time objectives (RPO/RTO) for our customers
  or in our contracts related to BCP/DR activities. Our SLAs are the cloud equivalent of the
  RTO/RPO data points.</p>

  <h3 id="testing-pandemicplan">Pandemic plan</h3>

  <p>Apigee includes a pandemic plan as part of our overall BCP/DR plan and processes. Because
  Apigee is a cloud hosted service, there is no requirement for individuals to manage the data
  center. For business operations such as support, Apigee operates a 24x7 global support team
  across multiple offices and remote locations. If a pandemic in one area of the globe impacts one
  of our support locations, personnel in other offices will be alerted and cover the shifts
  normally handled by the impacted office. For other business services such as sales, the workforce
  is globally distributed. All teams at Apigee are equipped to work remotely if needed. Tools used
  within Apigee are cloud-based and lend themselves naturally to a pandemic response plan.</p>

  <h3 id="testing-updates">Updates</h3>

  <p>Apigee reviews and updates our BCP/DR plan at least annually. Information gathered from
  incidents, product changes, industry standards, risk analysis activities, and BCP/DB testing are
  used to update the plan.</p>{% endblock %}
