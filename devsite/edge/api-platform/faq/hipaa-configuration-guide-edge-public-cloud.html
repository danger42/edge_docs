  {% extends "_base.html" %} {% block title %}HIPAA Configuration Guide for Edge Public Cloud{% endblock %} {% block body %}

  <p>This guide is for informational purposes only. Apigee does not intend the information or
    recommendations in this guide to constitute legal advice. Each customer is responsible for
    independently evaluating its own particular use of the services as appropriate to support
    its legal compliance obligations.</p>

  <p>The following items should be reviewed by customers subject to Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (known as HIPAA, as amended, including by the Health
    Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health â€” HITECH Act) who have purchased
    the HIPAA compliance pack. These items are self-service within Edge and can help support
    the customer organization (org) in meeting its HIPAA compliance obligations. The overarching
    concept is "Google secures the platform, the customer secures their data."</p>

  <h2 id="tracedebug">Trace / Debug</h2>

  <p>Trace/Debug is a troubleshooting tool that allows the user to view the status and
    contents of an API call as it is processed through the Apigee Message Processor.
    Trace and Debug are two names for the same service but accessed through different
    mechanisms. Trace is the name of this service inside of the Edge UI. Debug is the name
    of the same service when used through API calls. Use of the term Trace in this document
    is valid for both Trace and Debug.</p>

  <p>During a Trace session, "Data Masking" is enforced if enabled and configured by customer.
    This tool can block data from being displayed during a Trace. See the
    <a href="#masking">Data Masking</a> section below.</p>

  <p>Encrypted Key Value Maps (KVMs) are used for customers that require HIPAA compliance.
    With an encrypted KVM in use, Trace may still be used, but some variables will not be
    visible in the Trace display screen. It is possible to take additional steps to also
    display these variables during a Trace.</p>

  <p>Detailed instructions on the use of Trace are available at <a href=
  "/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html">Using the Trace tool</a>.</p>

  <p>Details on KVMs, including encrypted KVMs are available at <a href=
  "/api-platform/cache/key-value-maps.html">Working with key value maps</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="authorizations">Use/Authorizations</h2>

  <p>Access to Trace is managed through the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system for user
  accounts within Edge (<a href=
  "https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html">HIPAA
  compliance: Security - Access Control</a>). Detailed instructions on using the RBAC system to
  give and revoke Trace privileges are available at <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/understanding-roles.html">Assigning roles</a> and <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/creating-custom-roles.html">Creating custom roles in the
  UI</a>. Trace permissions allow the user to launch a Trace, stop a Trace, access the output from
  a Trace session.</p>

  <p>Since Trace has access to the payload of API calls (formally called the "Message Body"),
    it's important to consider who has access to run a Trace. Because user management is a
    customer responsibility, the granting of Trace permissions is also a customer responsibility.
    Apigee, as the platform owner, does have the ability to add a user to a customer org and
    to assign the privileges. This ability is only used upon customer request for support in
    a situation where it appears that the customer service is failing and reviewing a Trace
    session is believed to provide the best information on the root cause.</p>

  <h2 id="masking">Data Masking</h2>

  <p>Data masking prevents the display of sensitive data during a Trace/Debug session only,
    both in the Trace (Edge UI) and in the backend by Debug (Edge API). Details of how to set
    up Masking are available at
    <a href="/api-platform/security/data-masking.html">Data masking and hiding</a>.</p>

  <p>Data masking does NOT prevent the data from being visible in log files, the cache,
    analytics, etc. For help with data masking in logs, consider adding a regex pattern to
    logback.xml file. Sensitive data should typically not be written to cache or analytics
    without a strong business justification and review by your security and legal teams.</p>

  <h2 id="l1l2cache">L1 &amp; L2 cache</h2>

  <p>Use of the L1 cache will automatically use the L2 cache also. The L1 cache is "memory only"
    while the L2 cache writes data to disk to synchronize across multiple L1 caches. L2 cache
    is what keeps multiple Message Processors in sync within a region and globally. It is not
    currently possible to have L1 cache enabled without an L2 cache behind it. The L2 cache
    writes data to disk so that it can be synced to other message processors for the customer
    org. Detailed instructions on using the cache are available at
    <a href="/api-platform/cache/caching-edge.html">Adding caching and persistence</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="audit">Audit trail</h2>

  <p>Customers have the ability to review the Audit trail of all administrative activities
  performed within the customer's org, including the use of Trace (<a href=
  "https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html">HIPAA
  compliance: Security Management Process - Information System Activity Review</a>). Detailed
  Instructions are available
  <a href="https://community.apigee.com/articles/27175/apigee-edge-auditing.html">here</a> and
  at <a href="/api-platform/debug/using-trace-tool-0.html">Using the Trace tool</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="passwords">Complex password requirements or SAML</h2>

  <p>For HIPAA customers, user passwords are configured to meet advanced requirements such as
  length, complexity, rotation, and life span. (<a href=
  "https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html">HIPAA
  compliance: Security Password Management</a>)</p>

  <p>Edge also offers multi-factor authentication, described at <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/enable-two-factor-auth-your-apigee-account.html">Enable
  two-factor auth for your Apigee account</a>, and SAML, described at <a href=
  "/api-platform/system-administration/enabling-saml-authentication-edge.html">Enabling SAML
  Authentication for Edge</a>, as alternatives for authentication controls.</p>

  <h2 id="endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security</h2>

  <h3 id="scanning">Endpoint scanning</h3>

  <p>Edge Cloud customers are responsible for the scanning and testing of their API endpoints
  (sometimes called the "runtime components") in Edge
  (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html">
  HIPAA compliance: Security - Security Management Process</a>). Customer testing should cover
    the actual API proxy services hosted on Edge where API traffic is sent into Edge prior to
    being processed and then delivered to the customer datacenter. Testing of shared resources,
    such as the management portal UI, is not approved for individual customers (a 3rd party
    report covering testing of the shared services is available to customers under a
    non-disclosure agreement and upon request).</p>

  <p>Customers should, and are encouraged to, test their API endpoints. Your agreement with
    Apigee does not prohibit testing of your API endpoints, but does request you not test the
    shared management UI. Although if additional clarification is required, please open a
    support ticket referencing your planned testing. Notification to Apigee in advance
    is appreciated so that we can be aware of the testing traffic.</p>

  <p>Customers testing their endpoints should look for any API-specific issues, any issues
    related to Apigee services, and also check on the TLS and other configurable items. Any
    items that are found and related to Apigee services should be communicated to Apigee
    through a support ticket.</p>

  <p>Most items related to the endpoint are customer self-service items and can be fixed by
    reviewing the Edge documentation. If there are items where it is unclear how to fix them,
    please open a support request.</p>

  <h3 id="tls">TLS Configuration</h3>

  <p>Customers are responsible for defining and configuring their own TLS endpoints for API
    proxies. This is a self-service feature in Edge. Customer requirements around encryption,
    protocol, and algorithm selections are widely variable and specific to individual use cases.
    Because Apigee does not know the details of every customer's API design and data payloads,
    customers have the responsibility to determine appropriate encryption for data in transit
    (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html">
    HIPAA compliance: Security - Transmission)</a>.</p>

  <p>Detailed instructions on TLS configuration are available at
  <a href="/api-platform/system-administration/ssl.html">TLS/SSL</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="datastorage">Data Storage</h2>

  <p>Storage of data within Edge is not required for Edge to function properly. However,
    there are services available for data storage in Edge. Customers may choose to use the
    cache or analytics for data storage. Reviews of configuration, policies, and deployments
    by customer administrators is recommended to avoid an accidental or malicious use of data
    storage services in Edge in a non-compliant manner.</p>

  <h2 id="dataencryptionofthepayload">Data encryption of the payload</h2>

  <p>Data encryption tools are not offered to customers for their use inside of Edge. However,
    customers are free to encrypt data prior to sending to Edge. Encrypted data in the payload
    (or Message Body) does not prevent Edge from functioning. A few Edge policies may be unable
    to interact with the data if it is received encrypted by the customer. For example,
    a transformation is not possible if the data itself is not available to Edge to change.
    But other policies and customer-built policies and bundles will work even if the data payload
    is encrypted.</p>

<h2 id="pii">PII in URIs</h2>

<p>Apigee's unified analytics platform (UAP) captures analytics data, including any PHI or
  other sensitive data included in the uniform resource identifier (URI) of an API call into
  Apigee Edge, and retains it for 13 months. PHI in the URI is supported by Fast Healthcare
  Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards and is therefore supported by Apigee.
  Analytics data in the UAP is encrypted at rest by default.</p>

<p>Apigee currently does not support:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#masking">Data masking</a> to UAP</li>
  <li>Changing the retention cycle</li>
  <li>Opting out of UAP</li>
  <li>Dropping the URI from UAP data collection</li>
</ul>
