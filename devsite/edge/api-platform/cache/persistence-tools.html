  <p><strong>What's here</strong></p>

  <p>Apigee Edge mechanisms for caching and persistence include <strong>short-term</strong> and
  <strong>long-term</strong> persistence. There are policies for <strong>response</strong> caching
  and <strong>general purpose</strong> caching. Use the management API to <strong>manage
  caches</strong>.</p>

  <h2 id="backendresponsecaching">Backend response caching</h2>

  <p>You can cache the response of a backend resource with the
  <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy">Response Cache policy</a>.</p>

  <p>This is especially helpful when backend data is updated only periodically. The ResponseCache
  policy can reduce calls to backend data sources.</p>

  <p>Through the ResponseCache policy, you can also have Edge look at certain HTTP response caching
  headers and take actions according to header directives. For example, on responses from backend
  targets, Edge supports the <code>Cache-Control</code> header. This header can be used to control
  the maximum age of a cached response, among other things. For more information, see
  <a href="/api-platform/cache/http-response-caching">Support for HTTP response headers</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The policy uses either a cache you configure or a
  shared cache that's included by default. To use the underlying shared cache, simply omit the
  <code>&lt;CacheResource&gt;</code> element when configuring the policy. For more about
  configuring caches, see <a href="/api-platform/cache/manage-caches-environment">Creating and
  editing an environment cache</a>.</aside>

  <h2 id="shorttermgeneralpurposecaching">Short-term general purpose caching</h2>

  <p>Using policies for general purpose caching, you can persist any objects your proxy requires
  across multiple request/response sessions.</p>

  <p>With the <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/populate-cache-policy">Populate Cache
  policy</a>, <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/lookup-cache-policy">LookupCache
  policy</a>, and <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/invalidate-cache-policy">InvalidateCache policy</a>,
  you can populate, retrieve, and flush cached data at runtime.</p>

  <p>For example, you might temporarily store:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Session IDs for session management.</li>
    <li>Credentials for outbound calls (such as API keys or OAuth access tokens).</li>
    <li>Response content that must be paginated for apps.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At runtime, your cache policies copy values between proxy variables and the configured cache
  you specify. When a value is placed in the cache, it is copied from the variable you specify to
  the cache. When it is retrieved from the cache, it is copied into the variable for use by your
  proxy.</p>

  <p>For an example with code, see
  <a href="/api-platform/cache/optimize-performance-using-cache">Example: General purpose caching</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These policies use either a cache you configure or a shared
  cache that's included by default. To use the underlying shared cache, simply omit the
  <code>&lt;CacheResource&gt;</code> element when configuring the policy. For more about
  configuring caches, see <a href="/api-platform/cache/manage-caches-environment">Creating and
  editing an environment cache</a>.</aside>

  <aside class="key-point"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're wondering about how to cache an SSL certificate
  needed to make HTTP calls from a Node.js app running on Edge, see this
  <a href="https://community.apigee.com/questions/9028/caching-files-in-nodejs.html" class="external">Apigee Community
  post</a> for suggestions.</aside>

  <h2 id="longtermpersistenceofkeyvaluedata">Long-term persistence with key value maps (KVMs)</h2>

  <p>To indefinitely store structured data either encrypted or unencrypted, you can create and
  populate key value maps (KVMs) that contain arbitrary key/value pairs. For example, you might
  store:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A map correlating IP addresses to country codes.</li>
    <li>A list of IP addresses for whitelisting/blacklisting.</li>
    <li>A map correlating long URLs to shortened URLs.</li>
    <li>Environment-specific data, such as quota counts and OAuth token expiration times.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>KVMs can have one of three scopes: organization, environment, apiproxy. For example, if
  key/value pairs are to be used for all APIs in an organization, create a KVM at the organization
  scope; or if only a specific API proxy should have access to keys/values, create the KVM at the
  apiproxy scope. You can create, manage, and retrieve key value maps in a number of ways. For more
  information, see <a href="/api-platform/cache/key-value-maps">Working with key value maps</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="managingcachewiththemanagementapi">Managing cache with the management API</h2>

  <p>If you want to create, view, update, delete, and clear cache outside the scope of policies in
  a message flow, you can use the <a href="/api/caches">Caches management API</a>.</p>

  <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Note that you cannot manage the Edge "shared" cache
  with the management API. For more information on the shared cache, see
  <a href="/api-platform/cache/cache-internals">Cache internals</a>.</aside>
