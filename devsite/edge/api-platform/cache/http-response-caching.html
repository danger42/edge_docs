  <p>This topic describes how Edge handles HTTP/1.1 caching headers when you're using the
  ResponseCache policy. Apigee Edge currently supports a subset of the HTTP/1.1 caching headers and
  directives (unsupported features are listed in this topic) received from backend target (origin)
  servers.</p>

  <p>In addition, with certain headers Edge takes action based on their directives. In some cases,
  these HTTP/1.1 cache headers override whatever behavior is specified in the ResponseCache policy.
  For example, if the <code>Cache-Control</code> header is returned from a backend server, you can
  have the header's <code>s-maxage</code> directive potentially override other expiration settings
  in the policy.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The <a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP/1.1 specification</a> describes standard
  caching headers and control mechanisms that support caching along the HTTP request/response
  chain. These headers and mechanisms provide information about cached resources. They also help
  servers determine how to manage cached data. The specification itself contains detailed
  information about <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13">caching
  in HTTP</a>. There are also many blogs, articles, and other resources available on the Internet
  that explain HTTP caching.</aside>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> <b>Using headers to influence cache keys and cache entry TTL</b> You can have Edge
    use response headers when constructing response cache keys and setting cache entry TTL. To do
    this, you use these flag elements of the ResponseCache policy:

    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;UseResponseCacheHeaders&gt;</code> -- When this is set to <code>true</code>,
      Edge will consider HTTP response headers used when setting the "time to live" (TTL) of the
      response in the cache. For details, see "Setting cache entry expiration" and
      <code>&lt;UseResponseCacheHeaders&gt;</code> in <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy.html">Response Cache policy</a>.</li>

      <li><code>&lt;UseAcceptHeader&gt;</code> -- When this is set to <code>true</code>, Edge will
      use response <code>Accept</code> headers to augment the cache key. For more, see
      <code>&lt;UseAcceptHeader&gt;</code> in <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy.html">Response Cache policy</a>.</li>

  <h2 id="cache-control">Cache-Control</h2>

  <p>Apigee Edge supports the <code>Cache-Control</code> header only on responses returned from
  backend origin servers (the HTTP/1.1 spec allows <code>Cache-Control</code> headers in both
  client requests and origin server responses). Origin servers can include both target endpoints
  defined in an Apigee Edge API proxy and those created using TargetServer API calls.</p>

  <h3 id="cachecontrol-cachecontrolsupportlimitations">Cache-Control support limitations</h3>

  <p>Apigee Edge supports a subset of <code>Cache-Control</code> response header capabilities
  defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification. Please note the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Apigee Edge does not support <code>Cache-Control</code> headers that arrive with inbound
    client requests.</li>

    <li>Apigee Edge supports only the notion of public caches. (According to the HTTP
    specification, <code>Cache-Control</code> can either be public (shared) or private (single
    user).)</li>

    <li>Apigee Edge supports only a subset of <code>Cache-Control</code> response directives in the
    HTTP/1.1 specification. See <a href="#responseDirectives">Support for Cache-Control response
    header directives</a> for details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="responseDirectives">Support for Cache-Control response header directives</h3>

  <p>Apigee supports a subset directives from the HTTP/1.1 specification on responses from origin

  <h2 id="expires">Expires</h2>

  <p>When the <code>UseResponseCacheHeaders</code> flag in the ResponseCache policy is set to
  <code>true</code>, Edge can use the <code>Expires</code> header to determine the time to live
  (TTL) of a cached entry. This header specifies a date/time after which a response's cache entry
  is considered stale. This header allows servers to signal when it's okay to return a cached value
  based on a time stamp.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The <code>Cache-Control</code> header directives
  <code>max-age</code> and <code>s-maxage</code> take precedence over and override the
  <code>Expires</code> header. For more, see "Setting cache entry expiration" and
  <code>&lt;UseResponseCacheHeaders&gt;</code> in <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy.html">Response Cache policy</a>.</aside>

  <p>Acceptable date formats for the <code>Expires</code> header are described in the HTTP/1.1
  specification. For example:</p>

  <p>Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT</p>

  <p>For detailed information on HTTP date/time formats, see "<a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3">Date/Time Formats</a>" in the
  HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> While section 14.21 of the specification indicates that an
  <code>Expires</code> value of more than one year in the future means that a cache entry never
  expires, Apigee interprets such a value to mean that the entry should be cached until the
  specified date and time.</aside>

  <p>For more information on <code>Expires</code> header, see "<a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9">Header Field Definitions</a>"
  in the HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>

  <h2 id="Entity_Tag_support_">ETag</h2>

  <p>An entity tag (ETag) is an identifier associated with a requested resource. Using an ETag, a
  server can determine if the requested resource and the associated cached resource match. For
  example, the server could re-cache the response if it doesn't match what's currently cached. It
  could return the cached resource if the ETags match.</p>

  <p>When a target endpoint sends a response back to Edge with an ETag, Edge caches the ETag along
  with the response.</p>

  <p>You can read more about Entity Tags in " <a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.11">Protocol Parameters</a>" in the
  HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>

  <h3 id="If-Match_header_support">If-Match</h3>

  <p>With the <code>If-Match</code> request header, a cached entity is current if the ETag in the
  header matches the cached ETag. Any requests other than GET that specify an <code>If-Match</code>
  header are passed on to the origin server to ensure that any origin caching facilities have a
  chance to process the request.</p>

  <p>You can read more about <code>If-Match</code> in "<a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9">Header Field Definitions</a>"
  in the HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>

  <p>If Edge receives an inbound GET request from a client that includes an <code>If-Match</code>
  header:</p>

  <h3 id="If-None-Match">If-None-Match</h3>

  <p>With the <code>If-None-Match</code> header, a cached entity is current if the ETag in the

      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2 id="The_If-Modified-Since_header">If-Modified-Since</h2>

  <p>If Apigee Edge receives an <code>If-Modified-Since</code> header in a GET request, it is
  passed along to the origin server even if a valid cache entry exists.</p>

  <p>This ensures that any updates to a resource that did not pass through Apigee Edge are
  accounted for. If the origin server returns a new entity, then Edge replaces the existing cache
  entry with the new value. If the server returns a 304 Not Modified status, Edge returns the
  response value if the cached response's <code>Last-Modified</code> header indicates that it has
  not changed.</p>

  <h2 id="Accept-Encoding">Accept-Encoding</h2>

  <p>When an incoming request includes the header <code>Accept-Encoding</code> with values of
  <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code> or <code>compress</code>, the origin server responds with
  compressed data. When subsequent requests come without the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> headers,
  they expect an uncompressed response. Apigee's response caching mechanism is capable of sending
  both compressed and uncompressed responses depending on the incoming headers without going back
  to the origin server.</p>

  <p>You can have Accept header values appended to cache keys to make the keys more meaningful for
  each cached item. For more details, see "Configuring a cache key" in <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/response-cache-policy.html">Response Cache policy</a>.</p>{% endblock %}
