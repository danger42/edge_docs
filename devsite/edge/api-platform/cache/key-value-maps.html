  <p>There are times when you want to store data for retrieval at runtime&#8212;non-expiring data
  that shouldn't be hard-coded in your API proxy logic. Key value maps (KVMs) are ideal for this. A
  KVM is a custom collection of key/value String pairs that is either encrypted or unencrypted.
  Here are two examples:</p>

  <p><img src="/api-platform/images/kvm_examples.png"></p>

  <p>To learn about other types of persistence, see <a href=
  "/api-platform/cache/caching-edge.html">Adding caching and persistence</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="kvmscenarios">KVM scenarios</h2>

  <p>Here are some situations where KVMs come in handy:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You have an API proxy that needs to call one target (or Service Callout) URL in a test
    environment and another target URL in a production environment. Instead of hard-coding URLs in
    your proxy, you can have the proxy detect which environment it's in, execute the related Key
    Value Map Operations policy, and retrieve the correct target URL from one of the KVMs you
    created. And later, if one or both of your targets change, you simply update the KVMs with
    the new URLs. The proxy picks up the new values, and no proxy redeployment is required.</li>

    <li>You want to store credentials, private keys, or tokens&#8212;like tokens for external
    services (such as AWS Lambda), credentials required to generate OAuth tokens, or private keys
    used in Java Callouts or JavaScript for encryption or JSON Web Token (JWT) signing. Instead of
    passing credentials, keys, or tokens in the request, or hard-coding them in your proxy logic,
    you can store them in a KVM (always encrypted) and dynamically retrieve them in calls to
    targets that require them.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You'll discover other situations where storage of key/value String pairs is useful. In
  general, consider using KVMs when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Specific places in your code require different values at runtime.</li>

    <li>Sensitive data needs to be passed without hard-coding it.</li>

    <li>You want to store values that don't expire like a cache might.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="scope">KVMs have scope</h3>

  <p>Scope means "where a KVM is available." KVMs can be created at the following scopes:
  <code>organization</code>, <code>environment</code>, and <code>apiproxy</code>.</p>

  <p>For example, if only one API proxy requires data in a KVM, you can create the KVM at the
  <code>apiproxy</code> scope, where only that API proxy can access the data.</p>

  <p>Or you may want all API proxies in your test environment to have access to a key value map, in
  which case you'd create a key value map at the environment scope. Proxies deployed in the
  "prod" environment cannot access KVMs in the "test" environment scope. If you want the same KVM
  keys to be available in production, create a parallel KVM scoped to the "prod" environment.</p>

  <p>If you want all proxies in all environments to access the same KVM, create the KVM at the
  <code>organization</code> scope.</p>

  <aside class="note">
    <b>Note:</b> When creating and managing key value maps in the management UI, which this topic
    covers, you're creating them at the <code>environment</code> scope.

    <p>See <a href="#managing">Managing and using KVMs</a> for information on creating KVMs.</p>
  </aside>

  <h3 id="aboutencrypted">About encrypted KVMs</h3>

  <p>Encrypted KVMs are encrypted with an Apigee-generated AES-128 cipher key. The key used to
  encrypt a KVM is stored at the scope of the KVM. For example, within an organization, all
  encrypted KVMs you create at the environment scope are created using the same environment-scoped
  key.</p>

  <p>Edge handles the display of encrypted values in the following ways. (See <a href=
  "#managing">Managing and using KVMs</a> for information on creating encrypted KVMs.)</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Private Cloud:</b> In the Private Cloud, encrypted KVMs are only cached in
  the L1 cache. They are not cached in the L2 cache See <a href=
  "/api-platform/cache/cache-internals.html">Cache internals</a> for more on caching.</aside>

  <h4>Edge UI</h4>

  <p>Encrypted key value maps display values masked with asterisks in the UI (*****). For
  example:</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="/api-platform/images/kvm_encrypted.png"></p>

  <h4>Management API</h4>

  <p>In the management API, encrypted values are returned masked. Following is sample management
  API response on a Get encrypted KVM call:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "encrypted": true,
  "entry": [
    {
      "name": "Key1",
      "value": "*****"
    },
    {
      "name": "Key2",
      "value": "*****"
    }
  ],
  "name": "secretMap"
}
</pre>

  <h4>Trace and debug</h4>

  <p>When you use the <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/key-value-map-operations-policy.html">Key Value Map Operations
  policy</a> to retrieve encrypted KVM values, you supply the name of a variable to store the
  value. To get an encrypted value, you need to add the "<code>private.</code>" prefix to the
  variable name, which prevents the KVM keys/values from appearing in Trace and debug sessions.</p>

  <h2 id="managing">Managing and using KVMs</h2>

  <p>You can create, manage, and use KVMs in a variety of ways. This section describes different
  options for creating, then retrieving, both encrypted and unencrypted KVMs.</p>

  <h3 id="managingandusingkvms-creatingandupdatingkvms">Creating and updating KVMs</h3>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In organizations with <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/apis/api-reference-getting-started.html#cps" target="_blank">Core
  Persistence Services (CPS)</a> enabled:
    <ul>
      <li>The KVM name/identifier is case sensitive.</li>
      <li>Key size is limited to 2 KB.</li>
    </ul>
</aside>

  <p>You can create and update KVMs in the following ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Key Value Map Operations policy (no encryption)</strong></p>

      <p>For runtime KVM creation and update by your API proxies, use the <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/key-value-map-operations-policy.html">Key Value Map
      Operations policy</a>. (In the policy, you specify the name of the KVM in
      the <code><strong>mapIdentifier</strong></code> attribute on the parent
      element.)</p>

      <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> The policy doesn't currently support the creation of
      encrypted KVMs (use the management UI or API for this), but you can update encrypted KVMs
      with the policy.</aside>

      <p>The <code>&lt;InitialEntries&gt;</code> element lets you create and populate a
      baseline set of entries in a new KVM as soon as you save the policy in the UI or deploy the
      API proxy (if you developed it offline). If the values change in the policy, the existing
      values are overwritten. Any new keys/values are added to the existing KVM alongside the
      existing keys/values.</p>

      <p>The <code>&lt;Put&gt;</code> element creates a new KVM if one doesn't
      already exist, and it creates a key with one or more values. If the KVM already
      exists, they key/values are added (or updated if the key already exists). You can use
      multiple <code>&lt;Put&gt;</code> elements in a KVM policy.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Management API</strong></p>

      <p>The management API is for working with KVMs as an administrator rather than during runtime
      in your API proxies. For example, you may have an internal script that uses the management
      API to delete and recreate KVMs in a test environment, or you may want to reset a key's value
      in a KVM for all proxies to pick up. (For runtime manipulation of KVMs, use the <a href=
      "/api-platform/reference/policies/key-value-map-operations-policy.html">Key Value Map
      Operations policy</a> in your proxies).</p>

      <p>The <a href="/api-reference/content/keyvalue-maps-management-api">Key/Value Maps
      management API</a> lets you create, update, and delete encrypted KVMs and keys/values at
      all <a href="#scope">scopes</a> (organization, environment, and apiproxy).</p>

      <p>To create an encrypted KVM with the management API, add <code><strong>"encrypted" :
      "true"</strong></code> to the JSON payload. You can only encrypt KVMs when you create
      them. You cannot encrypt an existing KVM.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Management UI</strong></p>

      <p>In the Edge management UI, you can create and update <a href=
      "#scope">environment-scoped</a> KVMs, which are the only scope of KVM that
      appears in the UI. The management UI is a good way to manually administer KVM data for API
      proxies at runtime. See <a href=
      "/api-platform/cache/creating-and-editing-environment-keyvalue-maps.html">Creating and
      editing environment key value maps</a> for more information.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="managingandusingkvms-retrievingkvms">Retrieving KVMs</h3>

  <p>You retrieve encrypted and unencrypted key value maps the same way, with one slight variation
  when retrieving with the <a href=
  "/api-platform/reference/policies/key-value-map-operations-policy.html">Key Value Map Operations
  policy</a>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Policy</strong>: Use the <code>&lt;Get&gt;</code> element in the <a href=
    "/api-platform/reference/policies/key-value-map-operations-policy.html">Key Value Map
    Operations policy</a> to retrieve encrypted and unencrypted KVMs. The one slight difference is
    retrieving encrypted values with the policy, where you must add a "<code>private.</code>"
    prefix to the name of the variable that will contain the retrieved value, as described in the
    <a href="/api-platform/reference/policies/key-value-map-operations-policy.html#GetElement">Get
    operation section</a> of the reference topic. That prefix hides the value from Trace and debug
    sessions while you're debugging API proxies.</li>

    <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: If you're developing API proxies with Node.js, use the
    <code>apigee-access</code> module's KVM retrieval functions. The functions work identically on
    both encrypted and unencrypted KVMs. For more information, see <a href=
    "/api-platform/nodejs/accessing-key-value-maps-nodejs.html">Accessing key value maps in
    Node.js</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Management API</strong>: For administrative management purposes, you can use the
    <a href="/api-platform/cache/creating-and-editing-environment-keyvalue-maps.html">Creating and
    editing environment key value maps</a> to get KVMs and keys/values. For example, if you want to
    back up KVMs by getting and storing the JSON definitions, use the management API. Be aware,
    though, that encrypted values are displayed as ***** in the API response.</li>

    <li><strong>Management UI</strong>: You can view your environment-scoped KVMs in the management
    UI by going to <strong>APIs &gt; Environment Configuration &gt; Key Value Maps</strong>
    (Classic Edge) or <strong>Admin &gt; Environments &gt; Key Value Maps</strong> (New Edge).</li>
  </ul>
