  <p>This topic introduces Apigee Edge support for Node.js.</p>

<aside class="note">If you're planning to write a proxy that uses a Node.js app as its target, then
you might consider using <a href=

  <h2 id="aboutnodejsonapigeeedge">About Node.js on Apigee Edge</h2>

  <p>Node.js on Apigee Edge adds more programmability to the Edge API platform. Running on Edge,
  Node.js apps take advantage of Edge's enterprise-grade cloud operations like traffic management,
  security, deployment tools, revision control, logging, and analytics. Furthermore, you can
  leverage thousands of third-party Node.js modules in your APIs.</p>

  <aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you are new to Node.js, there are many excellent learning
  resources available online including books, videos, blogs, and the <a href=
  "https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org  website</a>. From this point on, we assume you are
  familiar with Node.js and are exploring how to integrate Node.js apps with Apigee Edge.</aside>

  <div>
    <p>Enterprise developers have found many creative ways to integrate Node.js applications into
    the Edge platform. Some common use cases include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Build highly customized <span style="font-weight: bold;">standalone
      APIs</span> and <strong>backend services</strong>.</li>

      <li>Build <span style="font-weight: bold;">backend logic for API BaaS</span> to
      leverage cloud data storage and management, user management, push notifications, and
      more.</li>

      <li>Solve complex <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">orchestration</span> and <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">mobile optimization</span> problems using Apigee policies with the
      advantage of a scriptable target endpoint.</li>

      <li>Build <strong>composite services</strong> and <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">mashups.</span></li>

      <li>Rapidly <span style="font-weight: bold;">develop prototypes</span> of new APIs
      using frameworks like <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href=
      "https://github.com/argo">Argo</a>, and <a href=
      "https://npmjs.org/package/usergrid">Usergrid</a>.</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    As you explore our set of Node.js topics, you will learn how to create API proxies with Node.js
    on Apigee Edge and how to deploy your existing Node.js applications to Edge.

  <div>
    <h2 id="showmethecode">Show me the code!</h2>

    <aside class="note"><b>Sample:</b> We recommend that you download and try out our Node.js API
    proxy sample code. You can access these Node.js samples here in the Apigee Edge API Services
    samples repository on GitHub: <a href=
    "https://github.com/apigee/node-samples">https://github.com/apigee/node-samples</a>. For
    more information on downloading Apigee samples, see <a href=
    "/api-platform/samples/using-samples.html">Using the sample API proxies</a>.</aside>

    <p>The Node.js repository contains a number of basic examples from deploying a simple Hello
    World! server to an employee database API that leverages a cloud-based datastore.</p>

    <p>We also recommend that you explore the Node.js samples in the API proxy cookbook. The
    cookbook samples focus on common problem-solving patterns related to API development, like
    writing backend Node.js logic to interact with API BaaS. See, for example, <a href=
    "/api-platform/samples/cookbook/building-baas-service-nodejs.html">Using Node.js to communicate
    with a backend data store</a>.</p>

    <p>Instructions for deploying and calling each sample API proxy are provided in the README file
    that comes with the sample.</p>

  <p>Now that you know a little about Node.js support in Apigee Edge, it's time to see Node.js on
  Edge in action. In the next topic, <a href=
  "/api-platform/nodejs/getting-started-nodejs-apigee-edge.html">Getting started with Node.js on
  Apigee Edge</a>, we'll show you how to proxy a very simple "Hello World" Node.js app on Apigee
  Edge using the management UI. Later, we'll show you how to deploy Node.js apps directly from your
  development machine to Edge using the command-line interface. </p>{% endblock %}
